Inclusive Practices: The Importance of LGBTQ+ Inclusion in the Christian University</h2> </a>      <div class="post__teaser--content__excerpt">       <p><em>Kerry Horrell, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Psychology, School of Humanities, Religion, and&nbsp;Social Sciences&nbsp;</em><br><br>At the beginning of each new year, I pick a word that represents something I would like to focus on for the upcoming year. For 2021, I chose the word cultivate, defined as âtrying to acquire or develop.â I am learning to love this word for its effortfulness, because this year, rather than attempt to manifest some new trait out of thin air, I wanted to recognize that growth and change often require intentionality, time, and the hard work of trying, over and over again. <br><br>With that in mind, I want to consider how this posture of practice might be relevant to our goals as a university community. How are we putting in the work to move us toward our vision and values, such as academic excellence, social justice, and holistic wellness? How are we moving beyond statements and ideas to actually creating a culture that reflects what we believe? One area that I am particularly interested in is cultivating an environment of inclusion. Specifically, I believe it is critical that we continue to foster inclusivity for the LGBTQ+ people in our community in order to meet our goals as a university. Let me explain why. <br><br>Over a decade ago, Campus Pride â an organization aimed at creating safer and friendlier college campuses for LGBTQ+ students â released a comprehensive report on the â2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People.â This report was the first of its kind, and it outlined that LGBTQ+ students tend to experience their college campuses as cold, unwelcoming, and even dangerous places (Rankin et al., 2010). This lived experience of the college community â often referred to as campus climate â has become an important focus of recent research, as it is associated with various outcomes for students. Among LGBTQ+ students, negative perceptions of campus climate have been found to be related to increased anxiety and depression, lowered academic success, and a high probability of leaving the university (Amodeo et al., 2020; Garvey et al., 2018). <br><br>Moreover, in her paper on âApplying the Seven Learning Principles to Creating LGBT-Inclusive Classrooms,â Dr. Michele DiPietro remarks that studentsâ prior knowledge impacts their learning experiences. Specifically, she says, âLGBT students may come to college with a sense of alienation stemming from having grown up in educational and social systems that devalue themâ (DiPietro, 2012, para. 3) Given that education and religion are two arenas where LGBTQ+ people have historically been discriminated against, this population is likely to enter Christian academia with uneasiness and skepticism. Therefore, not harassing is not enough. It is crucial that we â as the FPU community â consider how we can actively maintain a campus climate that is explicitly warm, welcoming, and safe for LGBTQ+ students and staff, as this directly impacts the ability for us to meet our goals of academic success, social justice, and holistic wellness. <br><br>Cultivating a culture means that we must all work together. So, the question that might be on your mind is: how do we keep up this sort of climate on our campus? Here are a few ideas and tips for practicing inclusion. <br><br><strong>1. Do no harm.</strong> Research has consistently shown that homophobia and transphobia, including microaggressions, are harmful. These could include misgendering people, being heteronormative, using disparaging language (e.g., âThatâs gayâ or âNo homo.â), or denial of bodily privacy. <br><br><strong>2. Be aware. </strong>It is important to recognize that sexual and gender identity is multifaceted and something to learn about people, as they are ready to share. Being aware can include asking people â and this means all people â their preferred pronouns, taking responsibility to learn more about queer issues, and considering the diverse and intersectional experiences of those who are LGBTQ+. <br><br><strong>3. Be active. </strong>Make your ally status known to those around you. This can be done by sharing queer-positive symbols, adopting inclusive language (e.g., as a recent Texas resident, I am fond of âyâallâ), and calling out discrimination, bigotry, and microaggressions when you hear them. <br><br>FPU has a long history of valuing and cultivating inclusion. Yet, this work is never complete, and I encourage us all to continue this legacy by practicing, over and over again, our posture toward inclusivity and love. <br><br><strong>References: </strong><br><br>Rankin, S., Weber, G., Blumenfeld, W., &amp; Frazer, S.

You hear the term âthe new normalâ but most of the writing, conferences or suggested seminars by various higher education businesses are speculative. We are all struggling with finding a clear path or road. As Lewis Carrollâs Cheshire Cat said in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>: âIf you donât know where you are going, any road will take you there.â</p>       <p>The vulnerability of the day lures us into fear, doubt, depression, distrust, anger and frustration. The road we once travelled before the pandemic seems different then this roadânow fraught with political and racial tensions, social distancing and isolationâthat confronts us with the dilemma of choice. Robert Frost expressed it this way: âTwo roads diverged in a wood and I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference.â</p>       <p>We often define our pathway by the influence of those things about us, including where the majority goes. If society is anxious, we are anxious. If the norm is to distrust and point the finger, then we point the finger. This path or road seems all familiar to the analogy Jesus uses in choosing between the broad road and the narrow road where few are willing to travel. This narrow road requires patience, humility, kindness and forgiveness which are all virtues of love.</p>       <p>Our post-pandemic journey is already mapped out for us despite our lack of knowledge about the future. Our challenge is the same as before the revelation of chaosâTrust in God. Proverbs 16:3 gives us further guidance for the future: âCommit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.â</p>       <p>Fresno Pacific Universityâs Strategic Map is the same as it was before the pandemic. It guided our response and planning during this pandemic, and it provides for us post-pandemic. We have not detoured or travelled a different path. Our road map is still the sameâGEIST: Grow Strategically, Engage Collectively, Innovate Creatively, Serve Courageously and Transform Purposely.</p>       <p>&nbsp;Some may have stepped off the path for the moment, distracted by their isolation. Others may have taken another road as the framework of their working virtually, but our leadership team and so many of our colleagues have been vigilant in guiding our work through storms, loss, uncertainty and disappointment. Our road less travelled is fill with faith, hope and love because we have the same guide (Jesus) we started with when this journey was in its nascent stage. His invitation to trust him has never changed. He invites us âto deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow him.â An appeal to live out love and courage which releases us from the bondage of fear. Our road map has not changed, but has adjusted to the present and will adapt to the future. On this journey we can trust one another to Grow Strategically, encourage each person to Engage Collectively, empower our colleagues to Innovate Creatively, surrender ourselves to Serve Courageously and with kindness Transform Purposely.</p>      </div>     </div>     <aside class="post__teaser--meta"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/connections" class="post__teaser--meta__site"> Connections </a>      <div class="post__teaser--meta__author">       <img src="https://www.fresno.edu/sites/default/files/joseph-jones-dr-square.jpg" alt="Joseph Jones, Ph.D." class="post__teaser--meta__author--image">       <p class="post__teaser--meta__author--name">Joseph Jones, Ph.D.</p>       <p class="post__teaser--meta__author--title">President</p>      </div> <time class="post__teaser--meta__date"> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--month"> March </p> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--day-year"> 08, 2021 </p> </time> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/connections/?post_type=post&amp;p=1719" class="post__teaser--meta__read-more">Read more</a>     </aside>    </article>    <article class="post__teaser">     <div class="post__teaser--content post__teaser--content--excerpt-text"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/connections/2021/03/03/following-jesus-call-in-an-unlikely-time/" class="post__teaser--content__title"> <h2>Following Jesusâ Call in an âUnlikelyâ Time</h2> </a>      <div class="post__teaser--content__excerpt">       <p>It was one year ago that the Board of Trustees gathered at our Visalia campus. Something called the coronavirus remained a vague threat. At that meeting the board watched a documentary entitled <em>Unlikely</em> which explored the inequities of opportunity in higher education. Our journey this past year has only aggravated the inequities described in that film as globally our social, economic and political connections with one another have been under enormous pressure. We must each ask ourselves what distinguishes us as Christians, individually and as an institution committed to higher learning in the midst of it all.</p>       <p>The mission of the church remains what it always has been. Jesusâ singular call through the Gospels is to âfollow me.â In <em>The Cost of Discipleship </em>Dietrich Bonhoeffer calls the Christian life one of âcostly grace.â That is to say, following Jesus means to give up the comforts of self-reliance and self-satisfaction, what Bonhoeffer calls âcheap grace,â and instead, with oneâs eyes firmly fixed on Jesus, live in obedience to his call. We must not just remember who we are but whom we follow.</p>       <p>To the Christian then, âEngaging the Cultures,â as the FPU slogan puts it, takes on a meaning at the center of our faith. The Christian âwalkâ is just that. If we are not walking in obedience we are not breathing life into our faith. This not only frames the boardâs discussions but serves to motivate, encourage and energize us all in our work.</p>       <p>One other item on our February 2020 agenda was a briefing on legislation then pending that would affect Christian higher education. This last weekend we again spent a significant amount of our time considering the state of affairs both in Congress and in the California Legislature. As a member of the Council for Christian Colleges &amp; Universities FPU has in that legislative affairs staff, and our own Donald Norman, a wonderful resource to draw upon to build relationships with legislators and to ensure that our voices are heard in the legislative process. Public policies that may sound appealing on one level often fail to account for the needs of institutions such as ours. We observe many proposals advance that affect how we carry out our mission and may pressure our ability to walk familiar paths as we seek to follow Jesusâ call. Federal and state support for students requires our vigilant defense.</p>       <p>Yet we also took time to celebrate some blessings through the last year. The construction of our new Warkentine Culture and Arts Center has begun and is fully funded. We continue to invite gifts for furnishings and other enhancements. Student populations vary but are within a stable range. Sports are happening on campus. And, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone, our budget is balanced.</p>       <p>I am proud to say that Fresno Pacific has touched a significant number of students from the Central Valley who emerge from various disadvantaged circumstances. They are, to borrow the term from our film of last year, âunlikely.â And what we do, we do out of sense of obedience to Jesusâ call. Please join the board in praying for Fresno Pacific, for our students and for who God calls them to be; for our faculty and staff who have carried the burdens of our mission in these times; for our president, Dr. Joe, the members of the cabinet and all with leadership responsibilities; and for the church at large for which Fresno Pacific is a ministry.</p>      </div>     </div>     <aside class="post__teaser--meta"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/connections" class="post__teaser--meta__site"> Connections </a>      <div class="post__teaser--meta__author">       <img src="https://www.fresno.edu/sites/default/files/Joshua_Wilson.jpg" alt="Joshua Wilson, J.D." class="post__teaser--meta__author--image">       <p class="post__teaser--meta__author--name">Joshua Wilson, J.D.</p>       <p class="post__teaser--meta__author--title">Chair, Fresno Pacific University Board of Trustees</p>      </div> <time class="post__teaser--meta__date"> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--month"> March </p> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--day-year"> 03, 2021 </p> </time> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/connections/?post_type=post&amp;p=1716" class="post__teaser--meta__read-more">Read more</a>     </aside>    </article>    <article class="post__teaser">     <div class="post__teaser--content post__teaser--content--excerpt-video"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/college-hour/2021/03/03/wednesday-march-3-2021-renewed-in-christ-acts-22/" class="post__teaser--content__title"> <h2>Wednesday, March 3, 2021: âRenewed in Christâ (Acts 22)</h2> </a>      <div class="post__teaser--content__excerpt"> <iframe title="Chapel: March 3, 2021: &amp;quot;Renewed in Christ&amp;quot; (Acts 22)" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/519070019?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>      </div>     </div>     <aside class="post__teaser--meta"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/college-hour" class="post__teaser--meta__site"> College Hour </a>      <div class="post__teaser--meta__author">       <p class="post__teaser--meta__author--name">Melanie Howard, Ph.D.</p>       <p class="post__teaser--meta__author--title">Assistant Professor &amp; Program Director, Biblical &amp; Theological Studies</p>      </div> <time class="post__teaser--meta__date"> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--month"> March </p> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--day-year"> 03, 2021 </p> </time> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/college-hour/?post_type=post&amp;p=1762" class="post__teaser--meta__read-more">Read more</a>     </aside>    </article>    <article class="post__teaser">     <div class="post__teaser--content post__teaser--content--excerpt-text"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/share/2021/03/02/a-disability-is-still-a-disability-even-when-its-not-visible/" class="post__teaser--content__title"> <h2>A Disability is Still a Disability, Even When itâs not Visible</h2> </a>      <div class="post__teaser--content__excerpt">       <p><em>Lisa Keith, Psy.D., Associate Professor, Program Director,&nbsp;Mild/Moderate Credential and&nbsp; Master of Arts in Special Education</em></p>       <p>If someone is vulnerable enough to share their pain with you, <br>be respectful enough to try and believe them. <br><br>The thing is, a disability is still a disability, even when itâs not visible. Mental health disabilities are among the most insidious disabilities globally because others don't believe that the behavior is often a sign of illness. Whether euphoric or depressed, belligerent or anxious, the signs and symptoms of mental illnesses such as depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders are manifestations of those illnesses. Things that those of us who live with these disabilities need from our friends and families are the hardest to come by: grace, acceptance, and inclusion. <br><br><strong>Grace.</strong> It may be difficult to extend grace to someone whose behavior can be erratic or unpredictable. Believe us; we'd prefer not to feel the feelings behind these behaviors. It may be challenging to forgive outbursts, and words said on impulse. However, the grace you extend to a person with a mental health disability is more than grace. It expresses understanding and love to the individual that although you may not understand how tortured we may feel, you know that this illness is beyond our control. Most mental illnesses are very treatable with talk therapy and medication. But that doesn't mean they are curable. Mental illnesses will affect one in five adults in the United States. It is chronic â meaning it comes and goes â and this unpredictable ebb and flow is even more difficult for those afflicted than those around them. No one wants to be viewed as problematic, or hot-tempered, or impulsive. It may feel like an extra burden to be a person of faith and to try and live up to the unattainable standards that our Christian community has for a predictable, even-tempered, and serene demeanor. <br><br><strong>Acceptance. </strong>Unconditional love. Itâs why I love Jesus. He knows me inside and out, accepts me with all my flaws, and even more so because of them. I have had people tell me if I would only pray harder, He would heal me. As if I haven't thought of praying? But I've come to accept for myself that for whatever reason, God â who I believe didn't cause my disability, after all, we live in a broken world â has chosen not to heal me. When I first became ill, I tried everything I could think of to find answers. I tried different doctors, therapists, medications. I tried twelve-step programs and self-help books, and finally, finally, found Jesus. I discovered a small Mennonite Brethren church that accepted me and showed me the love of Jesus. It was not easy for members. I could be disruptive and erratic in the days before I tried just the right combinations of medications I take today. I've tried twenty different medicines over my illness's first 15-year period, five other doctors, and numerous therapists. I still have to work very hard to present and pass as "normal." Well, as normal as I can be â whatever normal means. But I know that no matter who does or doesn't like and accept me as I am â warts and all â I am still a beloved child of God.; that I have been forgiven and have been extended grace and accepted by Jesus, a loving and a faithful God still amazes me. <br> <br><strong>Inclusion. </strong>Inclusion is a powerful thing. It can make or break a person inside and out. When I think of acceptance, oddly enough, I think of Winnie the Poo! Winnie was a great friend to Eeyore. He didn't judge, or disbelieve, or even try to change Eeyore. He extended grace, accepted that Eeyore was what he was, and included him every time. Every time there was a meal, or gathering, or even a simple walk to the cafeteria or coffee shop. No, I know there were no cafeterias and coffee shops in Hundred Acre Wood, but there are on the Fresno Pacific campus. It is a sweet blessing to be invited for coffee, even if one doesn't feel up to going. To be recognized and asked every time the group goes without fail is a blessing to someone who lives with depression and anxiety, for whom crowds can be too overwhelming, or for whom it may be a day when we can think of no cheerful rejoinder. Just being included is a simple act of showing God's grace, and love, and acceptance. <br><br>Friends, if you know someone with a mental health disability, don't be afraid. Show the love of Jesus, and just as He extends grace upon grace, continue to demonstrate acceptance and inclusion. And last but not least, include them in your circle. Don't count them out. They may one day be your best solace and dearest friend. <br><br>âFather, we thank you for all those among us who live with a mental health disability. We acknowledge their value and importance as members of our community. Father, God of the universe, show us how to love all peoples of every disability, whether visible or invisible. And Father, we ask for your blessings on each of us to be able to extend grace like you, to accept others the way you do, and include everyone among us even as you have accepted us into your kingdom. Amen.â <br><br></p>      </div>     </div>     <aside class="post__teaser--meta"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/share" class="post__teaser--meta__site"> SHARE </a>      <div class="post__teaser--meta__author">       <img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7b6aca43e680063c6e63b78e9d177092?s=96&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" alt="patty" class="post__teaser--meta__author--image">       <p class="post__teaser--meta__author--name">patty</p>      </div> <time class="post__teaser--meta__date"> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--month"> March </p> <p class="post__teaser--meta__date--day-year"> 02, 2021 </p> </time> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/share/?post_type=post&amp;p=29" class="post__teaser--meta__read-more">Read more</a>     </aside>    </article>    <article class="post__teaser">     <div class="post__teaser--content post__teaser--content--excerpt-text"> <a href="https://blogs.fresno.edu/college-hour/2021/03/01/pray-together-guide-for-week-8/" class="post__teaser--content__title"> <h2>Pray Together: Guide for Week 8</h2> </a>      <div class="post__teaser--content__excerpt">       <p>We invite the FPU Community to gather in prayer&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fresno.zoom.us/my/fpucollegehour" target="_blank">online</a>&nbsp;Monday mornings at 10 a.m. If you are unable to attend live, we encourage you to continue in a spirit of prayer with the following guide:</p>       <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">        <p><em>They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother</em> <em>of Jesus, and with his brothers.</em></p><cite>Acts 1:14</cite>       </blockquote>       <p><strong>Monday</strong> (Students): Residents</p>       <p><strong>Tuesday</strong> (Faculty): School of Business</p>       <ul>        <li>Katie Fleener</li>        <li>Jessica Kulzer</li>        <li>Michelle Bradford</li>        <li>Rodney Frese</li>        <li>Ranjan George</li>        <li>Breck Harris</li>        <li>Sylvia Kim</li>        <li>Catherine Peck</li>        <li>Benjamin Smith</li>        <li>Sharon Starcher</li>        <li>Suzana Dobric Veiss</li>       </ul>       <p><strong>Wednesday</strong> (Staff): Academic Success Center</p>       <ul>        <li>Kerry Sue Brown</li>        <li>Francisco Carrillo</li>        <li>Leann Lo</li>        <li>Javier Patino</li>        <li>Alfredo Ramirez</li>        <li>Judith Cunningham</li>        <li>Roseanne Galaviz</li>        <li>Beth Hunt </li>        <li>Melissa Perry</li>        <li>Sarah Micu</li>       </ul>       <p><strong>Thursday</strong> (Local Churches &amp;
