Most of the awards and prizes in our program are available to all fans, as long as their profile is completed in full. You can let us know a bit more about yourself via the Account button on the app.</p>     <p><em>DO I HAVE TO HAVE A SMARTPHONE IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE?</em> Yes. In order to check in, fans need to have a smart-phone with locations services turned on. Osprey Nation Student Rewards is available via iTunes and Google Play.</p>     <p><em>HOW DO I GET POINTS FOR ATTENDING Osprey Nation Student Rewards ATHLETIC EVENTS? </em> Download your respective version of the application that is compatible with your smart-phone. Once you register through the application you will click on events to find the event you are attending and click “Check In”. Your points will automatically be awarded to you upon a successful check-in.</p>     <p><em>HOW DO I “CHECK-IN” TO EVENTS?</em> Open the Osprey Nation Student Rewards App, choose the event you’re attending, and click on the “Check In To This Event.” Once you check-in the points will automatically be rewarded to you.</p>     <p><em>HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN I UNLOCK AN AWARD?</em> All awards list what is needed to unlock them on the awards tab on the application. Once you hit the required threshold for a particular award it will automatically unlock for you and you will receive a pop-up notification with a congratulatory message with further instructions on how to redeem and/or where to pick up your award. For further questions on how to redeem your awards, please contact an administrator.</p>     <p><em>CAN I EXCHANGE MY PRIZE FOR SOMETHING ELSE?</em> All purchases from the Prize Store and Award items are non-exchangeable and non-refundable.</p>     <p><em>DO POINTS ROLL OVER TO THE NEXT YEAR?</em> Points are accumulated over the course of the academic year. They roll over from season to season, but not year to year.</p>     <p><em>WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON’T SPEND ALL MY POINTS?</em> If you do not spend all of your points by the end of the school year and athletic season they were accumulated in, they will disappear. At the beginning of each year all participants begin with a score of Zero (0).</p>     <p><em>WHAT IF I HAVE A PROBLEM OR MALFUNCTION?</em> Under the account button on the app there is a Help / Feedback button on the bottom of the page to assist you with whatever happens. We can add points to your account, so rest assured, we will fix it!</p>     <hr>     <h1>RULES</h1>     <p>Osprey Nation Student Rewards rewards program is for all University of North Florida students, faculty, staff, and fans.
