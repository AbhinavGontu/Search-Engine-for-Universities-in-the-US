On Thursday, March 18 and Friday, March 19, the films will loop inside the the Tang’s Somers Classroom from 5 to 9 PM.The program features new works by Sarah Ema Friedland (Director, MDOCS Storytellers’ Institute), Matt McCormick, Kalpana Subramanian, Christin Turner, Mila Zuo, William Brown, Kelly Gallagher, Lori Felker, Courtney Stephens, Scott Cummings, Amir George, Eman Akram Nader, Alex Megaro, Mehrnaz Saeedvafa, as well as the two commissioning artists; Usama Alshaibi and Adam Sekuler. The films in CINEMA-19 do not attempt to summarize the pandemic, but instead focus on the personal, the political, the sensual, the distant, the abstract, and the absurd.To ensure a safe experience for all, we invite up to 10 people in the screening room at any given time, and ask that you sit at least six feet apart from each other.About Whole GrainThe Tang Teaching Museum’s Whole Grain series explores classic and contemporary work in experimental film and video.

Join at your leisure to crochet and chat as we create corals for a massive community art project, the Saratoga Springs Satellite Reef, part of the worldwide Crochet Coral Reef project by Christine and Margaret Wertheim and the Institute For Figuring. Coral creations submitted to the Museum will be assembled together to form the Saratoga Springs Satellite Reef, which will be exhibited as part of Radical Fiber: Threads Connecting Art and Science, opening in early 2022.Open to everyone, and all skill levels welcome!Check back for a Zoom link to join the event.Download the Institute for Figuring’s brochure How to Crochet Hyperbolic Corals.Skidmore students: We are assembling crochet kits (which includes a hook and yarn) and will have them available when you return to campus. Check back for details.About the Crochet Coral ReefThe Crochet Coral Reef is a project created by sisters Christine Wertheim and Margaret Wertheim of the Institute For Figuring. Residing at the intersection of mathematics, marine biology, handicraft, and community art practice, the project responds to the environmental crisis of global warming and the escalating problem of oceanic plastic trash by highlighting not only the damage humans do to earth’s ecology, but also our power for positive action. The Wertheims’ Crochet Coral Reef collection has been exhibited worldwide, including at the 2019 Venice Biennale, Andy Warhol Museum (Pittsburgh), Hayward Gallery (London), Science Gallery (Dublin), and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History (Washington, DC). The project also encompasses a community-art program in which more than 10,000 people around the world have participated in making more than 40 locally based Satellite Reefs—in New York, Chicago, Melbourne, Ireland, Latvia, UAE, and elsewhere. The Saratoga Springs Satellite Reef is the latest addition to this ever-evolving wooly archipelago.About the ArtistsMargaret Wertheim is a science writer, artist, and author of books on the cultural history of physics. Christine Wertheim is an experimental poet, performer, artist, and writer, and a faculty member at the California Institute of the Arts. Margaret and Christine conduct the Crochet Coral Reef project through their Los Angeles–based practice, the Institute For Figuring, which is dedicated to “the poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.” The IFF is at once an art endeavor and a framework for innovative public science engagement.Link: https://tang.skidmore.edu/calendar/1374-lunchtime-crochet-saratoga-springs-satellite-reef ","EventImageURL":"ImageWriter.aspx?ImageId=3532","ALTText":"orange and yellow crochet that looks like coral reef","isAllDay":false,"NoEndTime":false,"isSpecial":false,"Priority":0,"EventTypeColor":"#000000","EventTypeName":"Workshop","EventType":null,"AllowEdit":false,"Cancel":false,"CalendarName":"On Multiple Calendars","EventDateTime":{"EventDateTime":"3/17/2021 12:00:00 PM","EventDuaration":30,"EventTimeZone":"ET","DefaultUTCOffset":-240,"BaseDate":"\/Date(1615953600000)\/"},"Location":{"Id":1,"Name":"TANG Tang Teaching Museum","Address":""},"UDFs":null,"EventKeyWords":null,"Icon1":null,"Icon2":null,"SelectedTZBias":-240}];
