&amp; safety, and health outcomes—that impact precision health. Precision health is an innovative approach to health promotion, disease prevention, and healthcare treatment that takes into account individual differences in people’s genes, environments, and lifestyles.</p>     <ul>      <li>Determinants of health are the genetic, behavioral, social, and ecological factors that influence health indicators and health outcomes. These factors include people’s individual characteristics, behaviors, family, community, and social structures, and the environments in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and age.</li>      <li>Symptom science focuses on the understanding the biological and behavioral aspects of symptoms with the goal of developing and testing new interventions to reduce the disabling effects of symptoms and improving patient health and quality of life.</li>      <li>Data science is an interdisciplinary approach to extract information from structured or unstructured data to gain knowledge and insights for improved care.</li>      <li>Quality and safety is comprised of six dimensions of quality in healthcare: safety, effectiveness, patient-/family centeredness, timeliness, efficiency and equity.</li>      <li>Health outcomes are changes in individual, group or population health status that may be due to an intervention.</li>     </ul>     <h3 class="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SoN Research Faculty – 2018-19</span></h3>     <p><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">PAMELA K.

Dr Smith measures scientific health outcomes that are biological, social, educational and observable assessments.&nbsp; These outcomes have underscored her multiple clinical trial outcomes which empirically verify that her tested interventions prevent infection, depression, hospitalizations and guide family caregivers “how to” gain resources and support from peers and professionals.&nbsp; Dr. Smith’s clinical trials tested interventions support families managing complex home care including intestinal failure patients requiring daily 12-hour IV for survival, end-stage heart failure, and patients requiring home ventilators and those needing palliative care.</li>          <li>Dr. Smith has record of 38 years of consecutive NIH funding across the National Institutes of NINR, HLBL, Aging, NIDDK, and the Institute of Biomedical Engineering.&nbsp; Dr. Smith also completed an SBIR grant to develop/test a DVD series which illustrates complex home family home caregiving. These DVDs include 13 different ethnic patients, caregivers, nurse practitioners and MDs in various home care and clinic scenes. These DVD s were awarded the Robert Wood Johnson Transitions in Care Award. Dr. Smith’s effective translation of her interventions into practice have been adopted by international and national professional organizations, statewide hospital groups and local patient advocacy groups<strong></strong></li>         </ul> </li>        <li>Technologies/Methodologies:</li>       </ul>       <ul>        <ul>         <li>Dr Smith’s research interventions are delivered via telehealth technologies including videophones, iPads, and by her interactive award-winning internet sites.&nbsp; Her research team has published the cost efficiency methodologies for professionals delivering technology based illness management homecare.&nbsp; Her economic data from vulnerable inner city and rural families was an invited presentation for the National Medicaid Services.</li>        </ul>       </ul> </li>      <li>In addition, Dr. Smith has expertise in clinical trials conduct and using technology with severely ill patients and their family members to allow visual assessments, address complex challenges and to develop a joint plan of care acceptable to the families in rural or, intercity homes distant from specialist care.</li>      <li><strong>Faculty directory Link:</strong> <a href="http://nursing.kumc.edu/carol-e-smith-phd-rn-faan.html">http://nursing.kumc.edu/carol-e-smith-phd-rn-faan.html</a>&nbsp;</li>      <li>Dissertation Chair, Dissertation Committee Member</li>     </ul>     <p><strong>CYNTHIA S.

Dr. Teel’s work with the KSAC includes partnering to better define the nursing workforce in Kansas and identify needs of Kansas nurses. Among other projects, Dr. Teel’s team conducted the state’s first RN Workforce study, a nursing leadership needs assessment, determination of cultural competency awareness among nurses, and determining the presence of cultural awareness content among the state’s nursing educational programs. Each of these grant-funded projects has resulted in creating innovative, outcome-focused projects to address the identified needs. Most recently, the group is working on analyzing data from the 2016 Kansas Nurse Leader Residency Program and developing new resources for advancing cultural competency skill development, based on study findings.</li>      <li>Faculty Directory Link: <a href="http://nursing.kumc.edu/cynthia-teel-phd-faan.html">http://nursing.kumc.edu/cynthia-teel-phd-faan.html</a></li>      <li>Dissertation Chair, Dissertation Committee Member</li>     </ul>     <p><strong>KAREN A.

The goal of this research is to reduce negative health outcomes experienced by informal dementia caregivers.</li>          <li>Additional NIH-funded research found that applied problem-solving skills needed to maintain and improve cognitive function needed to manage everyday living in Assisted Living residences were improved in a group who received a cognitive training intervention that focused on reasoning and applied problem-solving skills compared to a control group.&nbsp;
