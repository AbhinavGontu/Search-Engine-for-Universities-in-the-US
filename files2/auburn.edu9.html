During these 31 years, more than 2,100 future veterinarians attended classes in the building. Today, Cary Hall has classrooms for biological sciences courses within the College of Sciences and Mathematics. Dean Cary came to Auburn in 1892 as a professor of veterinary science, and, in 1907, he established the College of Veterinary Medicine as the first one in the South. He served as dean until his death in 1935. In 1896, Cary helped to establish at Montgomery the first meat inspection system in the United States, following that up with meat and milk inspection ordinances in all major Alabama cities. The Alabama Legislature named Cary the state veterinarian in 1907, and, before the year’s end, he helped organize the Alabama Veterinary Medical Association. He also served as president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Cary is best known for his fight to rid Alabama livestock of fever ticks. His research also furthered the testing of brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle. He was named to the state’s Alabama Hall of Fame in 1957.","image":"https://cws.auburn.edu/map/Image/Building/23.jpg","hasImage":true,"kml":"<Polygon><outerBoundaryIs><LinearRing><coordinates>-85.4894324256,32.6047666477,0 -85.4894289791,32.604487575,0 -85.4895479935,32.6044865264,0 -85.4895475668,32.6044537624,0 -85.4897030816,32.6044524006,0 -85.4897029857,32.6044434954,0 -85.4898252154,32.6044424004,0 -85.4898253123,32.6044510865,0 -85.4899837815,32.6044496774,0 -85.4899841746,32.6044829094,0 -85.4901053976,32.6044818384,0 -85.4901068045,32.6045984375,0 -85.4900996269,32.6045985,0 -85.4901016065,32.6047607813,0 -85.4899730116,32.6047619142,0 -85.4899709984,32.6046001549,0 -85.4895591709,32.6046037836,0 -85.4895611835,32.6047655158,0 -85.4894324256,32.6047666477,0</coordinates></LinearRing></outerBoundaryIs></Polygon>","type":"bld","lastModified":"2015-07-14T13:09:09.22","enabled":true,"buildingcode":"AA_T0302","displaynewformat":true},{"id":71,"name":"Cater Hall","keywords":"Academic Advising,Academic Counseling-Advising Ctr,Auburn University Honors College,First Year Experience,First Year Experience Office,Honors Program,Interdisciplinary Studies Program,Office Of The Provost,Office Of Undergraduate Studies,Office Of Undergraduate Studies Academic Advising,Ous Academic Counseling-Advising Ct,The First Year Experience","address":"277 Thach Conc","departments":[{"id":911,"name":"Educational Support Services","url":"http://www.auburn.edu/ess"},{"id":262,"name":"Honors College","url":"https://fp.auburn.edu/honors"},{"id":611,"name":"Interdisciplinary Studies","url":"http://www.auburn.edu/idsc"},{"id":910,"name":"Learning Communities","url":"http://www.auburn.edu/lc"}],"description":"Built in 1915, Cater Hall originally served as the President's Home.

This three-story brick building was designed by Warren, Knight and Davis of Birmingham and constructed by the Southern Construction Company. It was named for President L. N. Duncan who began in 1920 to put aside a reserve each year for construction of the Extension Service Building. \r\n\r\nThe building is of Georgian style with limestone trim. The building was originally designed to use Indiana limestone, but Dr. Knapp and Professor Duncan requested an Alabama product be used, so limestone from Franklin County near Professor Duncan's home was selected. All materials used were Alabama products. The building was dedicated August 7, 1929, with Dr. Knapp presiding. In June of 1939, an extra wing was added which measured 70 feet by 18 feet, and the Duncan Hall garages were also built.","image":"https://cws.auburn.edu/map/Image/Building/113.jpg","hasImage":true,"kml":"<Polygon><outerBoundaryIs><LinearRing><coordinates>-85.4841705703,32.6004727309,0

Leach Nuclear Science Center was dedicated in 1967 as a nuclear science research and teaching facility. The building has 19,560 sq. ft. with space for radiation sources, research and teaching laboratories, 2 conference rooms, and offices for faculty and administrative personnel. The Risk Management and Safety program offices at Leach Science Center include Risk Management, Radiation Safety, Lab Safety and Fire Safety. Environmental Health and Safety and Occupational Health and Safety are housed at 971 Camp Auburn Rd.\r\n\r\nThe major research equipment includes a 2 Megavolt tandem accelerator, a Cobalt-60 Panoramic Irradiator, the Compact Auburn Torsatron (CAT) for the fusion energy research program of the Physics Department and a 6 Tesla Magnetic Dusty Plasma research system.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, administration was transferred to the College of Sciences and Mathematics and in 1998, to the Physics Department. More recently, the Center has been made available to interdisciplinary research groups with emphasis on semiconductor research.  Although the 60Co pool source and accelerator remain as major facilities for faculty research, the name of the Center was changed in 1996 to the Leach Science Center to reflect the Center's broader scope of scientific interests.","image":"https://cws.auburn.edu/map/Image/Building/61.jpg","hasImage":true,"kml":"<Polygon><outerBoundaryIs><LinearRing><coordinates>-85.4879377743,32.598618149,0 -85.4879404649,32.5982892064,0 -85.4881039477,32.5982901499,0 -85.4881034552,32.5983508102,0 -85.4884103876,32.5983526154,0 -85.4884098904,32.5984148142,0 -85.4884918424,32.5984152862,0 -85.4884913345,32.5984800143,0 -85.4887590455,32.5984815731,0 -85.488756284,32.5988211807,0 -85.4884913981,32.5988196567,0 -85.488492313,32.5987079018,0 -85.488403769,32.5987073837,0 -85.4884044574,32.5986208604,0 -85.4879377743,32.598618149,0</coordinates></LinearRing></outerBoundaryIs></Polygon>","type":"bld","lastModified":"2015-07-14T13:09:09.22","enabled":true,"buildingcode":"AA_U0801","displaynewformat":true},{"id":97,"name":"Leischuck Residence Hall","keywords":"Housing,Housing Administration,University Housing And Residence Life","address":"501 Duncan Dr","departments":[{"id":246,"name":"Gamma Phi Beta","url":"http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/greeks/gamma_phi_beta/"},{"id":265,"name":"Housing and Residence Life","url":"http://www.auburn.edu/administration/iss/admin_services/auxiliary/housing/"},{"id":365,"name":"Panhellenic Council","url":"http://www.auburn.edu/panhellenic"},{"id":449,"name":"Sigma Kappa","url":"http://www.ausigmakappa.com"}],"description":null,"image":"https://cws.auburn.edu/map/Image/Building/97.jpg","hasImage":true,"kml":"<Polygon><outerBoundaryIs><LinearRing><coordinates>-85.487282809,32.5968468645,0 -85.4872860274,32.5965585739,0 -85.4872759301,32.5965584911,0 -85.4872764751,32.5965095403,0 -85.4872869623,32.5965096242,0 -85.4872887981,32.5963446325,0 -85.4874258466,32.5963457241,0 -85.4874240595,32.596506704,0 -85.4874400668,32.5965068301,0 -85.4874394727,32.5965599866,0 -85.4874337907,32.596559943,0 -85.487431051,32.5968080505,0 -85.4874237787,32.5968079754,0 -85.487423333,32.5968479936,0 -85.487282809,32.5968468645,0</coordinates></LinearRing></outerBoundaryIs></Polygon>","type":"bld","lastModified":"2015-07-14T13:09:09.22","enabled":true,"buildingcode":"AA_V0905","displaynewformat":true},{"id":64,"name":"Little Residence Hall","keywords":"Housing,Housing Administration,University Housing And Residence Life","address":"304 Quad Dr","departments":[{"id":265,"name":"Housing and Residence Life","url":"http://www.auburn.edu/administration/iss/admin_services/auxiliary/housing/"}],"description":null,"image":"https://cws.auburn.edu/map/Image/Building/64.jpg","hasImage":true,"kml":"<Polygon><outerBoundaryIs><LinearRing><coordinates>-85.4851340972,32.6033626894,0 -85.4851341864,32.6033396198,0 -85.4852313772,32.6033398324,0 -85.4852317969,32.6032059785,0 -85.4852195882,32.6032059447,0 -85.4852198739,32.6031152696,0 -85.4852291604,32.6031152953,0 -85.4852296283,32.6029775099,0 -85.4852772636,32.6029776148,0 -85.4852774028,32.602933363,0 -85.4852673045,32.602933335,0 -85.4852673849,32.602911435,0 -85.4853245261,32.6029115933,0 -85.4853247108,32.6029340712,0 -85.485311073,32.6029341704,0 -85.4853115645,32.6029916448,0 -85.485365437,32.6029913269,0 -85.485367204,32.6032061057,0 -85.4854332537,32.6032057115,0 -85.4854333625,32.6032194546,0 -85.4854993462,32.6032190602,0 -85.4855001193,32.603313174,0 -85.4854383895,32.6033135522,0 -85.4854385082,32.6033247398,0 -85.4853158915,32.6033254445,0 -85.4853164232,32.6033895983,0 -85.4852180308,32.6033901769,0 -85.4852177821,32.6033621963,0 -85.4851340972,32.6033626894,0</coordinates></LinearRing></outerBoundaryIs></Polygon>","type":"bld","lastModified":"2015-07-14T13:09:09.22","enabled":true,"buildingcode":"AA_W0402","displaynewformat":true},{"id":25,"name":"Lowder Hall","keywords":"Access Control Center,Accounting,Au Dining Commissions And Expenditures,Auxiliary Enterprises,Campus Dining,Custodial Services,Finance,Harbert College Of Business,Maintenance &amp; Operations,Management,Marketing,Office Of Information Technology,Office Of The Registar,Systems And Technology,Tiger Dining,Utilities &amp; Energy","address":"405 W Magnolia Av","departments":[{"id":106,"name":"Auburn Technical Assistance Center","url":"http://www.auburnworks.org/"},{"id":759,"name":"Auburn Technical Assistance Center (ATAC)","url":"http://www.auburnworks.org"},{"id":133,"name":"Business, Raymond J.

The building was named for Otis David Smith, who was a trustee of the University of Alabama while also a professor of English and mathematics at Auburn. He also served as acting president of API following the death of President William Leroy Broun in 1902. The building was temporarily converted into a hospital in 1918 to accommodate students suffering from the killer Spanish flu. In 1921, it became a dormitory for women, but was burned in a fire in 1933. The Civilian Works Administration used the remaining exterior walls and rebuilt the structure as a classroom building.","image":"https://cws.auburn.edu/map/Image/Building/142.jpg","hasImage":true,"kml":"<Polygon><outerBoundaryIs><LinearRing><coordinates>-85.4813531324,32.6049763043,0

Corner","keywords":null,"address":"Corner of College and Magnolia","departments":[{"id":86,"name":"Athletics","url":"http://auburntigers.collegesports.com/"}],"description":"The  intersection of College St. and Magnolia Ave. is where the city of Auburn and Auburn University meet; it is the anchor point of Auburn's original 1856 campus from which today's campus has grown.  Auburn fans and friends gather to celebrate everything from athletic victories to the New Year.  Locally owned and operated Toomer’s Drugstore, serving the reputed best lemonade in the country since 1896, is a beloved Auburn icon. Getting to Toomer’s is usually fairly simple, unless you’re trying to get there after an Auburn victory. One of Auburn’s oldest and most notorious traditions is the “rolling” of the stately oak at Toomer’s corner following significant athletic victories. Thousands of AU faithful of all ages join in downtown Auburn to celebrate while hurling tissue paper into the surrounding trees, lamp posts, and anything that will stand still long enough. The exact date of the initial \"rolling\" of Toomer's Corner by students is unknown, but it was probably in 1962 or 1963. This unique Auburn tradition often lasts for hours, looking like a blizzard and leaving countless white strands of paper. This unique phenomenon gives Auburn the distinction of being the only city in the country with a line item in its budget for removing toilet tissue.","image":"https://cws.auburn.edu/map/Image/Building/165.jpg","hasImage":true,"kml":"<Polygon><outerBoundaryIs><LinearRing><coordinates>-85.481926,32.606691,0 -85.481937,32.606399,0 -85.481575,32.606408,0 -85.481569,32.60668,0 -85.481926,32.606691,0</coordinates></LinearRing></outerBoundaryIs></Polygon>","type":"clear","lastModified":"2015-07-14T13:09:09.22","enabled":true,"buildingcode":null,"displaynewformat":false},{"id":141,"name":"Chapel","keywords":"Auburn University Chapel","address":"139 S College St","departments":[],"description":"The chapel is the oldest public building in Auburn on its original site.

W. Walker, founder of Birmingham-based Walker Drug Company.  The School of Pharmacy was named the James I. Harrison School of Pharmacy in honor of the contributions Harrison and his family have made to the field of pharmacy in the state of Alabama.  Harrison's son, James I. Harrison, Jr., inspired a commitment toward the construction of a new addition plus the renovation of the Walker building. On March 1, 2006, the new Education and Clinic Wing was dedicated. The wing stands approximately on the site of the old auditorium. It occupies 45,000 square-feet of space and represents a portion of a $21 million plus construction/renovation project. Along with providing automated classrooms and wireless technology, the facility showcases state-of-the art learning environments including forty-four student-centered, team rooms; two new auditoriums; a student lounge; seminar rooms; and a pharmaceutical care clinic with ten exam rooms and a dispensary.  For a full history of the building and other information, please visit the Harrison School of Pharmacy website at
