International students must prove that they have sufficient funds available to them to pay for their educational and living expenses. More information about financing can be found on the <a href="https://www.sfa.ufl.edu/">Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships website</a>. An additional $6,000 is required if you are bringing a spouse and $2,500 for each child who may accompany you. Make copies of the certificate of financial responsibility for your records and for use at the U.S. Consulate. You cannot be issued the I-20 until you provide financial confirmation indicating full coverage of your estimated total cost of your educational and living expenses.</p>      <p>UF also requires all international students on non-immigrant visas have adequate medical insurance during all periods of enrollment.</p>      <p>More information about these requirements will be sent to students when they are admitted.</p>     </div>    </section>    <section>     <div class="row">      <h2 class="section-heading">Majors and Degree Requirements</h2>      <p>Information about undergraduate and graduate courses, degree requirements and academic regulations are included in the <a href="https://catalog.ufl.edu/">UF catalog website</a>.</p>     </div>    </section>    <section>     <div class="row">      <h2 class="section-heading">Transition to UF</h2>      <p>The University of Florida International Center (<abbr>UFIC</abbr>) is here to assist students with making a smooth transition to American culture and student life at the university. UFIC works with international students once admission is granted. One of the primary services provided by the UF International Center is to process the documentation for new incoming international students to obtain a student visa to study in the U.S. Our International Student Services unit is responsible for processing the Form I-20 for students seeking the F-1 student visa, and our Exchange Visitor Services unit is responsible for processing the Form DS-2019 for students seeking the J-1 student visa.
