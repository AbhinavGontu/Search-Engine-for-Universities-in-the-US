The University will provide rapid COVID testing before move-in for the Spring semester. Students should expect random testing through the semester for on-campus residents and those participating in student-activities and athletics. </p>                          <p><strong>At what point would students be sent home?</strong><br> Should positive Covid-19 cases increase on campus, consultation with state health guidelines, Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE), and professionals will continue, and we will determine any adjustments that would need to be made, including pivoting more courses to remote learning. In the event students are asked to return to their home residence, students returning home may vary based on several factors including major. For example, according to PDE some students may continue to receive face-to-face instruction even in the case of active COVID-19 on the campus due to the nature of their training and the need for hands-on curriculum.</p>                          <p><strong>Pack Pledge: </strong>Before returning to campus, students will be required to read and sign (in MyHusky) a statement of understanding that acknowledges the existence of the COVID-19 virus, its associated risks, and the expected student requirements for remaining compliant in practicing physical distancing (remain at least six feet apart), proper handwashing, mask-wearing, and the importance of testing and isolation/quarantine when indicated. Close contact, within six feet for a cumulative of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period to others, should be avoided. Crowds or groups in areas with inadequate ventilation should be avoided. The Pack Pledge can be found at <strong><a href="http://reslife.bloomu.edu/pack-pledge.php">http://reslife.bloomu.edu/pack-pledge.php</a></strong>.

Conditions and requirements are contingent on the persistence of COVID-19 cases across the entire on-campus housing system. Community Assistants and electronic messaging will be used to convey the visitation status and any changes. </p>                          <p>Resident students will be housed with roommates if originally selected in their housing application. However, private bedrooms will be made available to students at the double room rate, by request, based upon housing availability. Additional guidelines will include cleaning and sanitation protocols for rooms and room assignment plans for students with health considerations. Custodial staff will be cleaning common spaces more frequently and using disinfectants instead of general-purpose sanitizers. Cleaning frequencies are increased on high touch surfaces such as door handles, push bars, and elevator buttons. Move-in and move-out schedules will be spread out to reduce density and adhere to social distancing requirements. Failure to comply with cleaning, sanitation, visitor protocols, and Code of Conduct provisions in the residence halls may result in loss of student housing and/or housing deposits.

There will be outreach workshops available where counselors will share coping strategies to help you with resources and support.</p>                         </div>                        </div>                       </div>                      </div> <!-- // Content -->                     </div>                    </div> <!-- // Column -->                   </div>                  </div> <!-- -- // row inner ---->                 </div> <!-- // Row --> <!-- row -->                 <div class="builder-row builder-row-item-3 row-grey row-paddings-small " id="builder-row-15173-3">                  <div class="builder-row-inner builder-grid-container">                   <div class="builder-columns-wrapper builder-grid-row"> <!-- Column -->                    <div class="builder-column builder-column-item-1 col-md-12 col-lg-12">                     <div class="builder-content-column-group"> <!-- Content -->                      <div class="builder-content-wrapper">                       <div class="builder-content-inner">                        <div class="builder-content builder-content-builder builder-content-builder-custom-text">                         <div class="builder-content">                          <h2>Spring Semester Q&amp;A</h2>                          <hr>                         </div>                        </div>                       </div>                      </div> <!-- // Content -->                     </div>                    </div> <!-- // Column --> <!-- Column -->                    <div class="builder-column builder-column-item-2 col-md-12 col-lg-12">                     <div class="builder-content-column-group"> <!-- Content -->                      <div class="builder-content-wrapper">                       <div class="builder-content-inner">                        <div class="builder-content builder-content-builder builder-content-builder-custom-text">                         <div class="builder-content">                          <h3>Academics</h3>                          <p><strong>The Spring 2021 semester will begin on Feb. 1. </strong></p>                          <p>The Spring 2021 semester will start this Monday, Feb. 1, as scheduled. The only change is that the first two weeks, Feb. 1 through Feb. 12, ALL classes will be taught online. In-person instruction will now begin Monday, Feb. 15.</p>                          <p><strong>How do I get my textbooks?</strong></p>                          <p>Textbooks and school supplies can be ordered on the <strong><a href="http://bloomustore.com">University Store website</a></strong> and shipped to your home free of charge. </p>                          <p>If you are a local student and wish to pick up your books and supplies in-person, the University Store is now open. You may also order your books online and choose curbside pickup when completing your transaction. </p>                          <p>As a reminder, if you have excess financial aid, you may use it to purchase textbooks and school supplies on our website in addition to inside the store during the following dates: Sessions 1 and 2: Now through Monday, Feb. 8. Session 3: Friday, March 19 through Saturday, March 27. </p>                          <p>Be assured that the store will continue all of the following to keep you and their staff safe: masks fully covering mouth and nose required for all shoppers and staff, social distancing measures, increased cleaning protocols, reduced occupancy, and sneeze guards at all customer and staff contact points. </p>                          <p><strong>How can I tell what the course delivery method is?</strong></p>                          <p>To help you understand how a class is offered, refer to how to read your schedule <strong><a href="http://intranet.bloomu.edu/registrar">located on the Registrar’s Office page</a></strong>.</p>                          <p><strong>What is a modality?</strong></p>                          <p>Modality is the delivery method of the course. For Spring 2021, classes will be offered in the following modalities: </p>                          <ul>                           <li>Face-to-Face. Sections that are taught in a classroom or space in which both students and the faculty member are both present. For Fall 2020, the number of students in the class have been limited and larger classrooms have been assigned than where a class typically meets.</li>                           <li>Blended. Sections that are taught in more than one modality (Face-to-Face, Online-Synchronous, Online-Asynchronous). The goal is to maximize face-to-face contact time.</li>                           <li>Online-Synchronous. Class is taught remotely at days and times scheduled by the Registrar's Office or as per the faculty.</li>                           <li>Online-Asynchronous. Class materials, activities, and assignments are provided remotely and no day or time is regularly scheduled for the class.</li>                          </ul>                          <p><strong>On my schedule, I see Zoom for some classes and online for others. What’s the difference?</strong></p>                          <p>You may have seen that a “ZOOM” note has been added to one or more of your classes. A ZOOM room designation is a technology-enhanced room that enables a faculty to be able to deliver instruction face to face as well as remotely. Rooms with this designation are equipped with additional webcams and microphones to ensure active participation takes place during the class. These rooms will afford live interaction with faculty and other students.</p>                          <p><strong>Why did Bloomsburg decide to divide classes into the sessions?</strong></p>                          <p>The Spring 2021 semester is split into three sessions to maximize the amount of face-to-face instruction we could provide under social distancing rules. This allows multiple stop and start points to reduce the load.</p>                          <p><strong>Does this mean I don’t have classes all semester?</strong></p>                          <p>It would be very unlikely for a student to only have classes in Session 2 or Session 3. Students’ schedules will have a balance of Sessions 1, 2, and 3 courses.</p>                          <p><strong>Can students take more than two courses per seven-week period?</strong></p>                          <p>It's not recommended, but departments may utilize the overload approval process.</p>                          <p><strong>Will I have a fully online schedule?</strong></p>                          <p>It might be possible as we attempt to offer courses with multiple sections in all three formats (face-to-face, blended, and online). There will be occasions that your preferred methodology may not be available.</p>                          <p><strong>What's a technology-enhanced classroom?</strong></p>                          <p>This is a classroom that allows the professor to teach the lecture directly with students able to attend live or if they prefer, remotely, to access the course. These classrooms allow students to have a live course taught by the instructor but watch remotely. We have approximately 60 classrooms set up to allow a faculty member to teach traditionally with remote access.</p>                          <p><strong>Will the length of time each class meets be the same in the 7-week sessions as it is in a 15-week session?</strong></p>                          <p>The time in class roughly doubles for the condensed 7-week sessions. However, some of the professors may blend some of that contact time between face-to-face and remote instruction.</p>                          <p><strong>Can a student delay the start of the spring semester until the second seven-week session?</strong></p>                          <p>Yes. This plan is designed for students to be able to maintain their timely progress to graduation, even if they decide to delay their spring semester until the March 24 start-date. By taking courses during the second seven-week session, and by taking courses over the summer session, a student would be caught up to proceed with the Fall 2021 semester.</p>                          <p><strong>Will I be able to take a class via Zoom one day, then go in-person the next time it meets?</strong></p>                          <p>Possibly, with some courses. The faculty or instructor will communicate flexibility for courses.</p>                          <p><strong>How will classes and clinicals work for nursing majors?</strong></p>                          <p>You should anticipate a similar schedule to pre-COVID-19, with appropriate safety protocols in place.</p>                          <p><strong>Will education majors be able to do their Teacher Preparation Program Packet observations that are required before taking our higher-level courses?</strong></p>                          <p>Currently, students may complete these hours electronically via video and virtual observations. Resuming in-person observations will be determined based on what the schools are planning to allow. This communication is forthcoming, and subject to change, as schools continue to monitor and adjust their plans for the spring.</p>                          <p><strong>What should education majors do if the school district they're assigned to student teach has different restrictions than the area they live in?</strong></p>                          <p>Follow the guidelines of the district. Also, keep your cooperating teacher updated about conditions where you live. You may need to shift to remote instruction.</p>                          <p><strong>Will the pass/fail option be available this semester?</strong></p>                          <p>No. We're building in flexibility that was not available due to the rapid shift to online this last spring.</p>                          <p><strong>When will the Spring commencement be held, and when will that be announced?</strong></p>                          <p>The announcement about the <strong><a href="http://intranet.bloomu.edu/graduation">Spring 2021 commencement</a></strong> will be made at a later time. This allow us to make a determination as the semester progresses, given health and safety protocols that must be considered.</p>                          <p><strong>I'm a new BU student. How do I change my application to a different semester?</strong></p>                          <p>You can email the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at <strong><a href="mailto:buadmiss@bloomu.edu">buadmiss@bloomu.edu</a></strong> to request a semester change. Please include your full name and which semester you prefer (i.e. Fall 2021).</p>                          <p><strong>Will I be able to stay admitted in the same major if I change semesters?</strong></p>                          <p>In most cases, it's not a problem for you to remain in the same major. However, some majors, like Nursing, American Sign Language or Medical Imaging may not be able to be moved to a spring semester but will need to start the following fall. If you attend another college or university before attending BU, we may not be able to keep you admitted in Nursing or American Sign Language. Medical Imaging is only open to external transfers who have earned a rad-tech associate degree and are certified technologists.</p>                          <p><strong>What if I take college credits at another college then attend BU?</strong></p>                          <p>If you enroll in college courses elsewhere after graduating from high school, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will need to know where you will be attending and change your application status to a new transfer student. The office will need your official college transcript to review your college grades to ensure good academic standing and review for possible transfer credits. You must earn at least a “C” to earn credit from an accredited college/university. You can use our <strong><a href="http://adminapps.bloomu.edu/CourseEquivalency/ce">online course search tool</a></strong> to look for course equivalencies that transfer to BU from numerous colleges/universities. Before you register for classes at another college, it's a good idea to consult with a BU faculty member in the major you're considering to ask for course recommendations to help you transfer seamlessly to BU.</p>                          <p><strong>What happens to my student loans if I take a gap semester/year?</strong></p>                          <p>If you've received Federal Direct Loans or private loans in the past, you may be required to begin repayment. Typically, repayment begins six months after the last date of at least half-time enrollment. We encourage you to log into <strong><a href="http://NSLDS.ed.gov">NSLDS.ed.gov</a></strong> to determine your federal loan servicer and then contact them for specific repayment information. For private loans, please contact your lender.</p>                          <p><strong>What are other considerations for a gap semester/year?</strong></p>                          <p>If you decide to step away from Bloomsburg University, we encourage you to take a class or two at a community college if possible to stay on track towards your degree completion. Please complete a “Prior Approval of Transfer Credit” form in MyHusky to make sure whatever credits you take will transfer back to BU. It’s also important to complete the 2021-2022 FAFSA at <strong><a href="http://www.studentaid.gov">www.studentaid.gov</a></strong>, which is now available.</p>                          <p><strong>Will office hours still be held online?</strong></p>                          <p>Office hours should continue to be held online. Faculty should set up an open Zoom space to allow for drop-in attendance similar to face-to-face office hours.</p>                         </div>                        </div>                       </div>                      </div> <!-- // Content -->                     </div>                    </div> <!-- // Column -->                   </div>                  </div> <!-- -- // row inner ---->                 </div> <!-- // Row --> <!-- row -->                 <div class="builder-row builder-row-item-4 small-padding-top" id="builder-row-15173-4">                  <div class="builder-row-inner builder-grid-container">                   <div class="builder-columns-wrapper builder-grid-row"> <!-- Column -->                    <div class="builder-column builder-column-item-1 col-md-12 col-lg-12">                     <div class="builder-content-column-group"> <!-- Content -->                      <div class="builder-content-wrapper">                       <div class="builder-content-inner">                        <div class="builder-content builder-content-builder builder-content-builder-custom-text">                         <div class="builder-content">                          <h3>Student Account Billing (Tuition and Fees) and Financial Aid</h3>                          <p>Please visit the <strong><a href="https://intranet.bloomu.edu/documents/fin_bus_svcs/student-billing-fin-aid-faqs.pdf">Student Billing and Financial Aid FAQs</a></strong> to learn more about Spring 2021 student account billing, including drop/add and course withdrawal dates, and financial aid.

As was previously communicated via the <strong><a href="https://intranet.bloomu.edu/documents/fin_bus_svcs/student-billing-fin-aid-faqs.pdf">Student Billing and Financial Aid FAQs</a></strong>, there will be no proration for other fees because BU can offer a COVID-19 compliant, high-quality experience that mirrors the services/opportunities that were available pre-COVID-19.

We are confident that a satisfying and fulfilling experience can be obtained if everyone does what needs to be done to keep themselves and others well. This requires some sacrifice of event gatherings on and off campus where safety measures (specifically, social distancing, mask wearing, and frequent hand washing) are not followed. Keeping our students safe and healthy is the primary directive and it will supersede social events if the spread of COVID-19, again, gets to a point where additional controls need to be put in place.</p>                          <p>With that in mind, college affords abundant opportunities for students to interact and become involved in areas through a common interest or simple exploration. Communicating opportunities will look different and will be more reliant on electronic notification. Similarly, student groups and activity planners will continue to be more creative in how they conduct student group interactions and experiences. A full array of student activities will be planned from clubs and organizations to general student activities. Stay aware of virtual or in-person organizational meeting invitations and “pop-ins” to learn more.</p>                          <p>This aligns with what's done under more traditional circumstances and focuses on supporting and fostering connections via more virtual or socially distanced methods.</p>                          <p><strong>With many activities being done virtually how will BU build community?</strong></p>                          <p>A campus community starts with engagement and finding others with common interests. It takes a willingness to join a meeting or say hello to someone from a distance. A healthy community begins with appreciation and respect for others around you and a willingness to listen and be heard. The University, through its housing, clubs, and organizations, activities, and services, is the means to creating community. Take a chance, meet those around you, and get involved so that you take part in growing your Husky community.</p>                          <p><strong>How will public performances of events be coordinated?</strong></p>                          <p>Currently the numbers for any large gathering are determined by recent guidance from the Office of the Governor based on a variety of factors.

Testing will be administered before the start of the spring semester and ahead of assigned move-in times, and random testing will continue throughout the semester. All students who reside on campus, participate in athletics, or participate in extra-curricular activities will be required to complete COVID testing administered by the university. Failure to comply with required testing may result in action pursuant to the Student Code of Conduct. </p>                          <p><strong>Wearing of face coverings/masks: </strong>Experience demonstrates that when in public settings, face coverings reduce the spread of COVID-19. Face coverings should cover both mouth and nose with material that is secured to the head.</p>                          <p>Face coverings are required at all times where another person or persons who are not members of the individual's household (roommates) are present in the same space, irrespective of physical distance.<br> All areas of campus, both indoors and outdoors, are designated a "Mask Required Zone." Face coverings may only be removed while eating or when in the students assigned residential living space. If wearing a face covering while working would create an unsafe condition due to equipment operation, it may be removed for that task, as determined by the supervisor. </p>                          <p><strong>Social distancing: </strong>As used within this guidance, social distancing refers to individuals being physically separated by at least six feet. It is expected that all individuals will maintain social distance at all times, whether on or off-campus. All Individuals on campus, outside, or in buildings are required to wear face coverings. </p>                          <p><strong>Hygiene (CDC) requirements: </strong>Individuals should wash their hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used. Individuals should avoid touching their face and using their hands to cover coughs and sneezes instead of using a tissue or the inside of their elbow. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer. </p>                          <p><strong>Personal protective equipment and provisions to support a safe environment: </strong>Students are encouraged to bring any personal provisions such as face masks, hand-sanitizers, disinfectant wipes with them as part of move-in day, and personal supplies. </p>                          <p><strong>Husky Health Checker: </strong>All members of the BU community are strongly encouraged to monitor their health each day by <strong><a href="https://checkup.bloomu.edu/">utilizing the Husky Health Checker survey</a>.</strong> Upon completion of the survey, retain the badge on your mobile device by leaving your browser tab open or taking a screenshot, or on your computer by printing it or taking a picture of your screen using your mobile device.</p>                          <p><strong>Town: </strong>With the return to campus, Bloomsburg Town Police want to remind students about the importance of being good neighbors during these uncertain times. It is important to continue wearing a mask when off-campus and large gatherings of more than 25 and parties are prohibited. Large gatherings have been shown to be an easy way to spread COVID-19.
