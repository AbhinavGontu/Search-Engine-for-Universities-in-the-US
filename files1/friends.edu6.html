As a student athlete Dave participated in baseball, basketball and tennis. As a starter on the basketball team during his junior and senior year’s Dave’s quickness, hustle and determination were key elements to some very successful Falcon teams. As a senior Dave led the team in steals and assists which earned him recognition as a 1st team All-KCAC player. Friends University did not have tennis as a sport during Dave’s freshman year, hence the reason he spent the season playing baseball for the Falcons. During the next three years Friends University launched the tennis program and was anchored by Dave’s stellar play as a leader and member of the team. Dave was the number one single’s and double’s player for Friends University tennis during his sophomore, junior and senior years. During his senior year Dave did not lose a single match and was named All-KCAC. After graduating from Friends University Dave played on the ATP men’s tennis tour from 1989 to 1991.

Through his experience of coaching both athletes Dave has authored several sport-related books. For the past 15 years Dave has operated his own tennis training academy in Deerfield Beach Florida. He has launched more players onto the tennis tour in the last 10 years than any other american coach. Dave continues to write as he publishes a monthly tennis article and is a re-occurring guest analyst on NBC and ESPN.

Focusing attention in his first few years to stabilizing the financial leg of the University, Dr. Green set his sights on the structure and needs of the athletic department. An item of major concern was the lack of a track and field facility, in conjunction with a quality playing surface for the football and soccer programs. As a former football and track athlete, Dr. Green envisioned students attending Friends University and competing in a track and field program that would be competitive and rewarding. In 1998 through Dr. Green’s leadership, Friends University installed a state of the art synthetic playing surface for football and soccer, along with a collegiate level eight lane track for our student athletes. The synthetic playing surface was one of the first of its kind in the country, combining a special sand and rubber mixture that eventually was copied by many large NCAA schools, including the University of Nebraska. Next, Dr. Green worked to change the structure of the athletic department by implementing a full-time Director of Athletics, removing the duties of coaching a sport. The concept was to develop an athletic administrative model that would focus on balance and equity amongst all sports, attention to student recruitment and retention, along with quality financial management. This model is now being duplicated by other KCAC schools as well as many NAIA schools. Dr. Green’s next focus was the upgrade and enhancement of the Garvey Physical Education Center. Through his leadership, the Garvey Center underwent a $2.1 million dollar renovation with upgrades to all mechanical components, an expanded weight room facility, as well as a completely renovated gymnasium which includes new floor and graphic designs. But the most rewarding aspect of Dr. Green’s work towards Athletics, which cannot be measured in dollars, is his dedication and commitment to student athletes by attending their games, events, and practices.

During his tenure, the volleyball team won three conference championships in 1984, 1985 and 1987 and two district championships in 1985 and 1987, and he was named the KCAC Coach of the Year. The bi-District 9 championship in 1985 included Emporia State University, Pittsburg State University and Fort Hays State University in the field. That team went on to compete in the NAIA national tournament in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. David stressed the importance of teamwork and held his players to high academic standards, coaching two Academic All-Americans. He worked diligently during the off-season, raising scholarship money by organizing summer camps. Jana Mullen had this to say about Coach Waldie: “He’s a wonderful mentor and friend. Each off-season he would bring together the team for a retreat so we could learn how to be a team.” Tish Dimick adds: “Dave Waldie has an insight for ability. Players knew his expectations as a team and individuals that made each person strive for the best. His mild-mannered court demeanor was laid back, yet he didn’t lose his intensity. He was respected by players, teams, coaches and officials. The team could always count on an educational opportunity on extended road trips.”</p>       <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="#Top">Return to Top</a></p>       <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><a name="2001"></a>2001</b></span></p>       <p style="text-align: left;"><b><a name="davis"></a>Leslie Davis</b><br> Inducted in 2001<br> <b>Sports</b>: Basketball, Football, Baseball</p>       <p><img loading="lazy" style="float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1955_Davis_Leslie_EDIT.jpg" alt="" width="71.6" height="102.4">Leslie L.
