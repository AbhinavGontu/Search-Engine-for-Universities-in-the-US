Overture</h3> <h3>2. Chorus</h3> Time is supreme, Time is a mighty pow'r, <br> Whom wisest mortals will adore. <p> </p> <h3>3. Recitative</h3> <i>Beauty (looking in a mirror)</i> <br> How happy could I linger here, <br> And stop old Time in his career! <p> </p> <h3>4. Air</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Faithful mirror, fair-reflecting, <br> All my beauteous charms collecting, <br> Which, I fear, will soon decay. <br> Thou shalt flourish in thy splendour, <br> While these glories I surrender, <br> Horrid Time's devoted prey. <br> Faithful mirror. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>5. Recitative</h3> <i>Pleasure</i> <br> Fear not! I, Pleasure, swear <br> That these charms you still shall wear, <br> Ever blooming, ever fair. <p> <i>Beauty</i><br> Beauty, thy slave, this vow shall make,<br> Sweet Pleasure never to forsake;<br> And, if this vow I disregard,<br> In pain and anguish<br> Let me languish,<br> Tasting Folly's due reward.</p> <p> </p> <h3>6. Air</h3> <i>Pleasure</i> <br> Pensive sorrow, deep-possessing, <br> Life despoils of every blessing, <br> Wrapt in shades of piercing woe. <br> Who indulges grief's sad passion, <br> Sore vexation, <br> Knows no joyful day below. <br> Pensive sorrow. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>7. Recitative</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Despise Old Time. If short his stay, <br> Let ev'ry joy <br> The heart employ, <br> And pleasure still improve the day. <p> </p> <h3>8. Air and Chorus</h3> <i>Beauty and Chorus</i> <br> Come, come, live with Pleasure, <br> Taste in youth life's only�joy! <br> Old age knows no leisure, <br> Cares its wintry thoughts emp]oy. <p> </p> <h3>9. Recitative</h3> <i>Time (to Beauty)</i> <br> Turn, look on me! Behold old Time. <p> <i>Counsel</i><br> And see Counsel, the son of Truth.</p> <p> <i>Time</i><br> Who soon will show<br> How frail a flower Beauty is.</p> <p> <i>Counsel</i><br> The blossom of a day, that springs and dies.</p> <p> </p> <h3>10. Air</h3> <i>Counsel</i> <br> The beauty smiling, <br> All hearts beguiling, <br> Soon drooping, dying, <br> Returns no more. <br> The youth, now blooming, <br> And still presuming, <br> Few moments flying, <br> Shall charm no more. <br> The beauty. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>11. Recitative</h3> <i>Pleasure</i> <br> Our diff'rent pow'rs we try, and see <br> Who now shall gain the victory, <br> Pleasure, <p> <i>Beauty</i><br> Or Beauty,</p> <p> <i>Time</i><br> Time,</p> <p> <i>Counsel</i><br> Or Counsel.</p> <p> </p> <h3>12. Air</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Ever-flowing tides of pleasure <br> Shall transport me beyond measure <br> In this conflict with Old Time, <br> If he dares to despoil this choicest treasure. <br> Beauty, blooming in its prime. <br> Ever-flowing. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>13. Recitative</h3> <i>Time</i> <br> The hand of Time pulls down <br> The great colossus of the sun, <br> The stone-built castle, cloud-capt tow'r, <br> And shall Beauty oppose my pow'r? <p> </p> <h3>14. Air</h3> <i>Time</i> <br> Loathsome urns, disclose your treasure, <br> Pride and Pleasure, <br> Unveil to me, <br> That I may see <br> If now any <br> Spark of beauty still remains. <br> No, all dark as night! <br> Only worms their prey enjoying, <br> Dust and ashes still destroying, <br> Which my greedy tooth disdains. <br> Loathsome urns. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>15. Chorus</h3> Strengthen us, O Time, with all thy lore, <br> Teach us the ways of wisdom! <p> </p> <h3>16. Recitative</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Too rigid the reproof you give, <br> Too deep the search of Truth. <br> Wise men will still in pleasure live, <br> And still enjoy, <br> Without annoy, <br> The proper fruits of youth. <p> </p> <h3>17. Air</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Happy Beauty, who fortune now smiling, <br> Now with gay Pleasure and sport Time beguiling, <br> Still enjoys the sweets of April's life. <br> Come, indulge then no doubts to perplex you, <br> Nor permit any sorrow to vex you, <br> But live free from all care and all strife. <br> Happy Beauty. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>18. Air and Chorus</h3> <i>Deceit and Chorus</i> <br> Happy, if still they reign in pleasure, <br> All the sweets of youth caressing; <br> Happy, if slighting Time's dull measure, <br> They enjoy the present blessing. <p> </p> <h3>19. Recitative</h3> <i>Counsel</i> <br> Youth is not rich in Time; it may be poor, <br> Nor can he call his own the passing hour. <p> <i>Time</i><br> Hence, let thy thoughts on frailty range,<br> And know that every day<br> Some charm I make my lawful prey,<br> Though unperceiv'd the change.</p> <p> <i>Pleasure</i><br> He best, he only life employs,<br> Who will not think how fast it flies.</p> <p> <i>Counsel</i><br> Yet, ere it is too late, give ear,<br> And this instructive lesson hear.</p> <p> </p> <h3>20. Air and Chorus</h3> <i>Time and Chorus</i> <br> Like the shadow, life ever is flying, <br> All unnotic'd, so swift the delusion. <br> Man heeds not Time, on hope still relying, <br> Soon the bell strikes, and all is confusion. <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <h1>ACT TWO</h1> &nbsp; <p> </p> <h3>21. Soli (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) and Chorus</h3> Pleasure submits to pain, <br> As day gives way to night, <br> And sorrow smiles again, <br> As Time sets all things right. <br> Thus are the seasons chang'd, <br> And all in turn appear, <br> In various order rang'd, <br> Throughout the whole revolving year. <br> Pleasure. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>22. Recitative</h3> <i>Pleasure</i> <br> Here Pleasure keeps his splendid court, <br> Where all his devotees resort; <br> And, at his nod, advance <br> The costly feast, the carol, and the dance, <br> Minstrels and music, poetry and play, <br> The dance by night, and manly sports by day. <p> </p> <h3>23. Symphony (flourish of horns)</h3> <h3>24. Recitative</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Hark! What sounds are these I hear? <p> </p> <h3>25. Chorus</h3> Oh, how great the glory <br> That crowns the hunter's toil! <br> Like Theseus, fam'd in story, <br> He triumphs in the spoil. <p> </p> <h3>26. Air</h3> <i>Pleasure</i> <br> Dryads, Sylvans, with fair Flora, <br> Come, adorn this joyful place; <br> Come, fair Iris and Aurora, <br> This our festival to grace! <p> </p> <h3>27. Solo (soprano) and Chorus</h3> Lo! We all attend on Flora, <br> To adorn this joyful place. <br> Iris comes, with fair Aurora, <br> This your festival to grace. <p> </p> <h3>28. Air</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> No more complaining, <br> No more disdaining, <br> See Pleasure reigning <br> Without control. <br> Still more delighting, <br> Sweetly inviting, <br> New charms exciting <br> The raptur'd soul. <br> No more. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>29. Air</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Pleasure's gentle Zephyrs playing, <br> Bid thee sail, without delaying, <br> And the port of bliss obtain. <br> Let not doubtful fear confound thee, <br> Taste the joys that now surround thee, <br> Nor let Pleasure smile in vain. <br> Pleasure's gentle. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>30. Air</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Come, O Time, and thy broad wings displaying, <br> Might essaying, <br> Sweep away, <br> Without delay, <br> The joyous pleasures of this sweet abode. <br> Lo! He sleepeth, no more his strength prevailing, <br> No more his pow'r availing <br> To destroy life's sovereign good. <br> Come, O Time. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>31. Air</h3> <i>Counsel</i> <br> Mortals think that Time is sleeping, <br> When so swiftly unseen he's sailing. <br> But he comes, with ruin sweeping, <br> In his triumph never failing. <br> Mortals think. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>32. Recitative</h3> <i>Time (to Beauty)</i> <br> You hop'd to call in vain, but see me here! <br> These lower regions are my proper sphere. <br> Would you then dread no more <br> My hated pow'r, <br> Prepare thee for a nobler flight, <br> Amidst the realms of light. <br> Time cannot climb the blissful sky, <br> Nor reach to immortality. <p> </p> <h3>33. Air</h3> <i>Time (to Beauty)</i> <br> False destructive ways of Pleasure <br> Leave, and court a nobler treasure <br> In the starry realms above. <br> Here though Folly's sons defy me, <br> Yet in vain they seek to fly me, <br> While through all the world I rove. <br> False destructive. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>34. Recitative</h3> <i>Counsel (to Beauty)</i> <br> Too long deluded you have been <br> By Pleasure's false and flatt'ring scene. <br> Behold fair Truth, the heav'nly image see, <br> Not decked, but fairest in simplicity: <br> White robes of innocence she wears, <br> Her look, her thoughts, turn'd to her kindred spheres. <p> <i>Time</i><br> Behold her faithful mirror too,<br> Presenting all things to your view<br> By just reflection, be they false or true.</p> <p> </p> <h3>35. Air</h3> <i>Pleasure</i> <br> Lovely Beauty, close those eyes, <br> Charming Beauty, oh look not there! <br> In that view all pleasure dies, <br> In reflection is sure despair. <br> Lovely Beauty. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>36. Recitative</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Seek not to know what known will prove <br> Grief more severe than slighted love. <p> </p> <h3>37. Air</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Melancholy <br> Is a folly, <br> Wave all sorrow <br> Until tomorrow, <br> Life consists in the present hour. <br> This dear treasure we adore <br> With grateful ardour, still employing, <br> Still enjoying, <br> The sweet moments in our pow'r. <br> Melancholy. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>38. Recitative</h3> <i>Time</i> <br> What is the present hour? 'Tis born and gone! <br> Think on the years already flown, <br> Think you will see the bliss, but see in vain, <br> Think on convicted error's self-tormenting pain. <p> <i>Beauty</i><br> No more! I know not where to turn,<br> My heart's too sad to laugh, too gay to mourn.</p> <p> </p> <h3>39. Air</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Fain would I, two hearts enjoying, <br> This in penitence employing, <br> Freely that resign to joy. <p> </p> <h3>40. Recitative</h3> <i>Counsel</i> <br> Vain the delights of age or youth, <br> Without the sanction and applause of Truth. <br> And as the soul more bright appears <br> Than the frail earthly form she wears, <br> So much true pleasures, from this glass, <br> All other sublunary joys surpass. <p> </p> <h3>41. Air</h3> <i>Counsel</i> <br> On the valleys, dark and cheerless, <br> From the mountain's summit, fearless, <br> Soon you'll with contempt look down; <br> And these darling pleasures slighting, <br> In sublimer views delighting, <br> Disbelieve that choice your own. <br> On the valleys. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>42. Recitative</h3> <i>Time</i> <br> Not venial error this, but stubborn pride, <br> To leave a sure and friendly guide, <br> Who, seeing you bewilder'd stray, <br> Points out the short and easy way. <br> See, see the happy port before you lies, <br> And Time exhorts you to be wise. <p> <i>Beauty</i><br> Darkly as through a cloud, I see<br> The immense treasures of futurity,<br> But present joys my heart so fill<br> That, though inclin'd, I cannot will<br> To leave this scene for immortality.</p> <p> <i>Counsel</i><br> Hear the call of Truth and Duty,<br> And to Folly bid adieu.<br> Ere to dust is chang'd thy beauty,<br> Change thy heart, and good pursue.</p> <p> </p> <h3>43. Chorus</h3> Ere to dust is chang'd thy beauty, <br> Change thy heart, and good pursue. <p> &nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <h1>ACT THREE</h1> &nbsp; <p> </p> <h3>44. Symphony</h3> <h3>45. Recitative</h3> <i>Deceit (to Beauty)</i> <br> Once more I thee address, <br> Regardful of thy happiness. <p> </p> <h3>46. Air</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Charming Beauty, stop the starting tear from flowing <br> All adown the rosy cheek. <br> Pleasure still new charms bestowing, <br> Ever cheerful Pleasure seek. <br> Charming Beauty. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>47. Recitative</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Tempt me no more, <br> Your words give no relief; <br> I know no pleasure <br> But in virtuous grief. <p> </p> <h3>48. Air</h3> <i>Deceit</i> <br> Sharp thorns despising, <br> Cull fragrant roses! <br> Why seek you pleasures <br> Mix'd with alloy? <br> Old age surprising, <br> Soon the scene closes; <br> Life's only treasure's <br> Life to enjoy. <br> Sharp thorns. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>49. Recitative</h3> <i>Counsel</i> <br> Regard her not. Unvalu'd here <br> Such tears may fall, but know each tear will prove <br> A precious pearl in Heav'n above. <p> <i>Beauty</i><br> Soft and prevailing is thy voice. Alas,<br> Too long I've err'd! Put forth the heav'nly glass!</p> <p> <i>Counsel</i><br> Behold, it waits your view!</p> <p> <i>Beauty</i><br> Now, Pleasure, take my last adieu!</p> <p> </p> <h3>50. Air</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Pleasure! <br> My former ways resigning, <br> To Virtue's cause inclining, <br> Thee, Pleasure, now I leave, <br> Lest, when my strength shall fail me, <br> No sorrow can avail me, <br> Nor sickness comfort give. <br> Pleasure. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>51. Recitative</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Since the immortal mirror I possess, <br> Where Truth's reflected beauties glow, <br> Thee faithless form, deluding glass, <br> Thee to thy native earth I throw. <p> <i>Pleasure</i><br> Ah, stay, forbear!</p> <p> <i>Counsel (to Pleasure)</i><br> In vain you this prevention dare.</p> <p> </p> <h3>52. Air</h3> <i>Counsel</i> <br> Thus to ground, thou false, delusive, <br> Flatt'ring mirror, thee I throw. <br> Thou who, with vain art abusive, <br> Didst exalt each charming feature, <br> Far beyond the pride of nature, <br> Feigning happiness below. <br> Thus to ground. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>53. Accompagnato</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> O mighty Truth! Thy power I see, <br> All that was fair seems now deformity. <br> This day my pride shall from its height descend, <br> This day my reign of vanity shall end. <br> Adieu, vain world! In search of greater good, <br> I'll pass my days in sacred solitude; <br> 'Tis fit the slave of vanity should dwell <br> In some sequester'd penitential cell. <p> </p> <h3>54. Air</h3> <i>Time</i> <br> From the heart that feels my warning, <br> Grateful are the tears that flow. <br> Pearly drops, the flow'rs adorning, <br> Grace not more the dewy morning, <br> Nor such blessings can bestow. <br> From the heart. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>55. Recitative</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Pleasure, too long associates we have been, <br> Now share conviction from Truth's faithful scene, <br> Or to thy native darkness fly. <p> <i>Pleasure</i><br> As with Error I long have been dwelling,<br> I with Truth now can have no contentment.</p> <p> </p> <h3>56. Air</h3> <i>Pleasure</i> <br> Like clouds, stormy winds then impelling, <br> Disdainful I fly with resentment. <br> Hark! The thunder round me rolls, <br> Truth's awful angry frowns I see; <br> Her arrows wound my trembling soul, <br> Nor is there any joy for me. <br> Ah no, Truth drives me to despair, <br> Open, ye rocks, and hide me there. <br> Like clouds. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>57. Recitative</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Farewell! � Now Truth, descending from the sky, <br> Clad in bright beams, its glorious light displays. <br> Oh, thither let me cast my longing eye, <br> And strive to merit her inspiring rays. <p> </p> <h3>58. Air</h3> <i>Beauty</i> <br> Guardian angels, oh, protect me, <br> And in Virtue's path direct me, <br> While resign'd to Heav'n above. <br> Let no more this world deceive me, <br> Nor let idle passions grieve me, <br> Strong in faith, in hope, in love. <br> Guardian angels. . . <i>da capo</i> <p> </p> <h3>59.
