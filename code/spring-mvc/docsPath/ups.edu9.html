     <h2><br>Title IX and all Sex/Gender Based Discrimination, Harassment, and Misconduct</h2> 
     <p>"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance." <em>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972</em></p> 
     <p>Although frequently associated with allowing women to participate in sports, Title IX&nbsp;is a federal law that&nbsp; protects all members of the campus community from discrimination on the basis of sex&nbsp;in the universityâs education programs and activities, including prohibitions on&nbsp;gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment,&nbsp;and sexual violence such as rape (including attempted rape), stalking, verbal abuse, and other sexual misconduct.</p> 
     <p>The University of Puget Sound is committed to upholding the rights granted by Title IX and to fully investigating and addressing Title IX violations. Puget Sound takes pride in cultivating a safe and proactive community with respect to sexual discrimination, gender violence prevention and education, and sexual assault and harassment response.</p> 
     <h2><br>Campus Policy Prohibiting Discrimination and Harassment</h2> 
     <p>The University of Puget Sound values and celebrates a diverse educational community based on mutual respect, trust, and responsibility. The university believes its students, faculty members and all other staff members should learn, teach, work, serve and lead in an environment free from discrimination and harassment. (Discrimination and harassment, as used in this policy, are defined below in Section II.B and C.)</p> 
     <p>The university is a community that encourages a rich knowledge of self and others, an appreciation of commonality and difference, the full, open, and civil discussion of ideas, thoughtful moral discourse, and the integration of learning. Academic freedom and freedom of expression are vital to our shared goals. Expression occurring in an academic, educational or research context is broadly protected by academic freedom. (See <a href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/2017-18-faculty-code.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faculty Code, Chapter I, Part E</a> and <a href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/student-life/personal-safety/student-handbook/student-integrity-code/integrity-principle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Student Integrity Principle</a>.)&nbsp; However, discrimination, including harassment, compromises the integrity of the university. Accordingly, the university is committed to taking action to prevent, correct, and where appropriate, discipline discrimination and harassment as defined by this policy.&nbsp;</p>
