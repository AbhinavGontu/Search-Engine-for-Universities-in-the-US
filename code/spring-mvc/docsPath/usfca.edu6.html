     <h2>Day One</h2>
     <p>Let’s talk about move in day. As an out of state student who hadn’t visited the university for over a year and a half, it was very scary. I remember an overall state of denial. Fun fact I had never even spent 24 hours in San Francisco before. So it was rather overwhelming for me.<br></p>
     <p>If possible, I do suggest visiting the city and trying to get your lay of the land a bit better. I do have family in the Bay Area, so I had seen it before. However, there is a difference between just going to the same tourist spots (personally Union Square, Chinatown, and the de Young) and actually living there. So, if you can, spend some time in the Richmond District, which is the area that the university is in. Oh and notice Trader Joe’s and Target are a short walk away. </p>
     <p>Back to the crazy day: don’t get me wrong, I was excited! My Snapchat story even featured Karl the Fog on the Golden Gate Bridge. But turning the corner onto Golden Gate Avenue was like taking a leap into the great unknown. Luckily everyone was very helpful, but I definitely resembled a deer in the headlights. </p>
     <p>Just remember that everyone is there to help you, answer any questions you have, help with anything you need from the car, etc. You can talk to any of the current students there. My sorority and other members of Greek Life will be there too, so you’ll actually make their day more exciting with questions! Don’t be afraid to speak up!</p>
     <p>I choppily remember setting up my room and then leaving campus to go eat with my mom and uncle then coming back for the orientation activities. Once I started meeting more of the people on my floor I felt more comfortable, I ended up becoming bestfriends with two girls from dear old Phelan fourth. </p>
     <p>This year I will be missing move in day because I am studying abroad in London <a href="https://href.li/?http://gph.is/1hmm2Xx" target="_blank">*cue grand finale fireworks*</a> so find someone in a KAΘ shirt to help :D Also remember, try to get a lay of the land, even using Google maps to get yourself acquainted before you move in. On the day of don’t forget to talk to the people around you and just breathe. Have faith that you can do something great here.<br></p>

     <h2>Residence Hall Realities</h2>
     <p>My experience living in the dorms really was great. Looking back on freshman year, I had so much fun in Gillson, my freshman year residence hall, and met so many great people that I’m still friends with and have continued to live with through my years here at USF. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
     <p>Thinking back on when I moved into Gillson as a freshman, I was both anxious and excited. It was a scary thought to leave the stability of my life behind just to move in to a room shared with a stranger and a bathroom shared with 50 other people. But the nerves subsided quite quickly as I began making friends with my roommate and other people on my floor. You adapt so fast and so easily and you’ll wonder what there was to worry about in the first place. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
     <p>One word of advice to incoming freshman living in a residence hall for the first time would be to keep your door open! Once you’ve moved in and are acclimated, keeping your door open is a great indication of sociability. My roommate and I used to do that when we were in our room, and we made good friends with the girls across the hall because of this. Freshman year, everybody just wants to make friends. It’s a lot less intimidating to approach a room of people you don’t know when their door is open, rather than gathering the strength to knock on a door with strangers on the other side of it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Also, don’t be afraid of your RAs! They’re there as an ally and they truly are there just to assist you with whatever issues you may have. They’re a good resource to go to if you’re having an issue or just want to chat with somebody. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Living in a dorm is such a unique experience that you won’t come by in the future, so look at it as something to get excited over! You’ll look back fondly, even if at the time it was a little bit challenging. But take the opportunity to meet people and build connections that you’ll maintain forever, because you won’t get this kind of experience again!<br></p>

     <h2>Views</h2>
     <p>If I had to pick one little thing about USF that I absolutely love, it would have to be the incredible views that we have all over campus! One thing that San Francisco is definitely known for is its hills. The amount of slopes people have to climb just to get around the city always throws tourists and newcomers to the city off. But with great hills come great views. USF is built on one of the tallest points in the whole city. It seems like no matter where you are on campus, whether you are in one of the residence halls or at the top of Lone Mountain stairs, there is always a great view to look at. USF is also located pretty much right in the center of San Francisco. This little factor combined with being on the hilltop means that you can see pretty much every part of the city from campus. Some of my favorite spots where I like to enjoy the view is the little picnic table area right in front of Rossi Wing and the top of the LoMo steps. The ability to see the entire city of San Francisco everyday is definitely what makes USF unique and it is one little thing that I appreciate every time I am on campus; just how lucky we are to be located where we are located. To give you a sample of some of the views we do have on campus, here is a picture of one of the incredible views we have on campus.</p>
