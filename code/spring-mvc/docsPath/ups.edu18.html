     <h1>Leadership for a Changing World</h1> 
     <p class="introduction">University of Puget Sound 2018-28 Strategic Plan</p>
     <p>University of Puget Sound enters the coming decade in a strong position. We are a stable and well-managed institution, ideally located in the Pacific Northwest, where the ethos of innovation, possibility, and individual determination is very much a part of our campus culture. As we look to the challenges and opportunities of the future, we will build on our strengths to guide our national liberal arts college to its next level of distinction and success.</p> 
     <p>Throughout 2017-18, the university—its students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and trustees—worked together to develop <em>Leadership for a Changing World,</em> a student-centered strategic plan guided by our vision and values, built on our mission and educational goals, and supported by a commitment to do all that we can to make a Puget Sound education ever more meaningful, relevant, accessible, and distinctive. Endorsed by the board of trustees in October 2018, the plan guides our work over the coming decade, inspiring us to be bold and forward-looking in the delivery of our residential liberal arts education to meet the needs of this and future generations of students.<br><br><a class="button_link" href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/support-puget-sound/presidents-annual-report-2019-20/">2019-20 PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL REPORT</a></p>
