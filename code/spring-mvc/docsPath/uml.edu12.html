     <h2>Jonas Software as Data Processor</h2> 
     <p>In certain cases, we also operate as a data processor and we collect and process personal information on behalf of our business customers in the provision of our services and products. In these circumstances, Jonas Software is acting as a data processor and our business customers remain the data controller in respect of personal information they provide to us.</p> 
     <p>Our business customers remain the data controllers with respect to any customer information that they provide to us for our provision of services. To the extent that we are acting as data processor, we therefore act in accordance with the instructions of such customers regarding the collection, processing, storage, deletion and transfer of customer information, as well as other matters such as the provision of access to and rectification of customer. We will only use such personal information for the purposes of providing the services and products for which our business customers have engaged us.</p> 
     <p>Our business customers are responsible for ensuring that these individuals privacy is respected, including communicating to the individuals in their own privacy policies who their personal information is being shared with and processed by. Where Jonas Software is acting as a data processor, we will refer any request from an individual for access to personal information which we hold about them to our customer. We will not respond directly to the request.</p> 
     <p>As a data processor, we may share personal information where instructed by our business customer. Where authorized by the business customer, we may also share personal information with third party service providers who work for us and who are subject to security and confidentiality obligations.</p> <a name="_Toc514929964"></a> 
     <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data to Third Parties</h2> 
     <p>We may share your personal information with our group companies, affiliates, subsidiaries or contractors as necessary to carry out the purposes for which the information was supplied or collected (i.e. to provide the services and products you have requested from us). Personal information will also be shared with our third party service providers and business partners who assist with the running of the Sites and our services and products including hosting providers, email service providers and payment processing partners. Our third party service providers and business partners are subject to security and confidentiality obligations and are only permitted to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p> 
     <p>In addition, we may disclose information about you when we believe that such use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: comply with any legal or regulatory obligation; establish, exercise or defend the rights of Jonas Software, our staff, customers or others; and protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our users, or others.</p> <a name="_Toc514929965"></a> 
     <h2>International Transfers</h2> 
     <p><em>If you are based in the EU or EEA</em></p> 
     <p>We may share your personal data within the Jonas Group. This involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to Jonas affiliates and third party service providers in Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Malaysia. Canada and New Zealand have been deemed by the EU as having an adequate level of protection for personal data. Whenever we transfer your personal data outside the EEA to the countries identified above which have not been deemed by the EU to have an adequate level of protection for personal data, and specifically to the US, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission (as permitted under Article 46(2)(c)) that are designed to help safeguard your privacy rights.</p> <a name="_Toc514929966"></a> 
     <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2> 
     <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use appropriate measures to safeguard personally identifiable information, which measures are appropriate to the type of information maintained, and follow applicable laws regarding the safeguarding of any such information under our control. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. The Internet by its nature is a public forum, and we encourage you to use caution when disclosing information online. Often, you are in the best situation to protect yourself online. You are responsible for protecting your username and password from third party access, and for selecting passwords that are secure.</p> <a name="_Toc514929967"></a> 
     <h2>Data Retention: How Long We Keep Your Personal Data</h2> 
     <p>We will retain personal information which we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services and products to our customers and in accordance with any agreement in place with our customers. When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues that you might be facing. Your information may be retained for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirement.</p> <a name="_Toc514929968"></a> 
     <h2>Your Rights</h2> 
     <p>You may request from us access to, correction of, blocking of and/or deletion of your personal data in line with applicable data protection law. You may also withdraw your consent for us to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. Where your personal data is processed by us with your consent or for the performance of a contract by automated means, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format upon request.</p> 
     <h3>Responding to Requests</h3> 
     <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. Also, please note that we may refuse a request for blocking and/or deletion where the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p> <a name="_Toc514929969"></a>
