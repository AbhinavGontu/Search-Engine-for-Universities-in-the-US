     <hr> 
     <p>The Montana University System and the Board of Regents of Higher Education approves all student fee charges. Fees are subject to change at any time.</p> 
     <p>Students are personally responsible for meeting their financial obligations at the times stated in the term calendar. A student’s registration is not complete until all fees are paid.</p> 
     <p>All students are urged to safeguard their personal funds by establishing checking accounts. It is most helpful for a student to be able to write checks for exact amounts for fees, room and board, and other necessary expenses. A local bank account is also good identification while on campus.</p> 
     <p>Student charges and refunds are posted under the student’s name, not the parent’s. Therefore, all fee statements and bill notifications are emailed to the student, not the parents. Student refunds are Direct Deposited or mailed to the student if the student has not signed up for Direct Deposit. (Exception: Refund checks generated as a result of a Parent PLUS loan are mailed to the parents unless the Financial Aid Office has written authorization to disburse the funds to the student.)</p> 
     <p>A check presented to MSU which is subsequently returned by the bank for insufficient funds or other reasons may cause the cancellation of a student’s registration, reporting to federal agencies, and/or a request to terminate room and board. A returned check service charge of $25 is assessed for all returned checks.</p>

     <h3>Office of Financial Aid Services</h3> 
     <p>The Office of Financial Aid Services at Montana State University administers federal, state, and institutional aid programs designed to help eligible students pay for their educational expenses. Amounts of awards vary and depend upon the student ’s financial need as well as the amount of funds available for distribution.</p> 
     <p>To apply for financial aid, students and parents of dependent students must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year. The FAFSA can be filed electronically at <a href="http://www.fafsa.gov">www.fafsa.gov</a>.</p> 
     <p>To be eligible for financial aid, an individual must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and have applied for admission to the University as a degree-seeking student. Priority consideration is given to students who file the FAFSA by MSU’s financial aid priority filing date, which is December 1 of the preceding year (e.g., Dec 1, 2017 for the academic year beginning in Fall Semester 2018).</p> 
     <p>Students applying for financial assistance are considered for all aid programs for which they are eligible. Assistance is offered in the form of grants, scholarships, tuition waivers, student and parent loans, and work opportunities.</p> 
     <p>Publications describing the different programs, eligibility criteria, satisfactory progress, and application procedures are available via the Internet at <a href="http://www.montana.edu/wwwfa/" target="_blank">www.montana.edu/wwwfa/</a>, or at the Office of Financial Aid Services, 183 Strand Union, P.O. Box 174160, Bozeman, MT 59717-4160. Our telephone number is: (406) 994-2845.</p> 
     <p>Both undergraduate and graduate students may apply for aid. Assistance to graduate students is generally limited to long-term loans and work opportunities. Information on graduate fellowships, scholarships, and assistantships may be obtained from The Graduate School.</p> 
     <p>Although student expenses will vary according to differences in courses of study, residency status, housing arrangements, transportation costs, and other factors, the table of estimated expenses may be used to determine the projected cost of education for a school year (two semesters). In estimating costs, between-semester expenses should not be overlooked.</p> 
     <p>Please remember that policies and procedures governing financial assistance at MSU are subject to change at any time, without prior notification or publication, due to changes in university, state, and/or federal guidelines and regulations.</p> 
     <p>The Office of Financial Aid Services is open Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM or as otherwise posted. The office is located in Room 183 in the Strand Union Building which is equipped with an elevator for disabled students.</p>
