       <p>“Only through art can we reduce the world itself to our own, human measure. Art is not made to the absolute dimensions of the world. Instead, humanity distorts those dimensions in, through, and by the art it makes. Art is the human imposed upon the natural, objectively verifiable world. No matter how distorted it is, artistic interpretation consists of something that must be humanized. And to the degree of that distortion’s reach of the imagination, that amount of convincing interpretation, the world is cognitively remade by the artist for mankind.</p> 
       <p>The present exhibition at NMHU’s Kennedy Hall offers a generous sampling of the variety of painting by New Mexico artists today. Any broad selection of New Mexico art will inevitably contain ambitious landscape painting, and that is true of this Fourth Invitational, as it was of the previous three exhibitions. But there is a range of other subject matter as well, such as still-life and portraiture, contemporary and traditional culture.” – James Mann</p> 
       <p>Exhibition runs from September 17 through October 25, 2017.</p>

       <p>Opening reception Friday, August 4th from 4-7 PM. Free and open to the public.</p> 
       <p>Artist and curator Duke Sundt has organized an exhibition at Kennedy Gallery illustrating the culture, landscape, and inherent beauty of the Southwest. “This exhibit reflects the spirit of New Mexico” says Duke, who invited artists Janeil Anderson, Ron Kil, Noble Brooks Read, Elaine Querry, Kimberly Reed-Deemer, Linda McThoy Cobb, Gary Morton, and Scott Vail to share with him in this creation of reflection. Bringing together these artists working in various styles and mediums from bronze sculpture to photography and painting, the show will not only provide a multi-faceted reflection, but also illustrate the rich heritage of Las Vegas.</p>

       <p>From Wood Ducks and Canadian Geese to Fulvous Whistling Ducks and Hooded Mergansers these limited edition prints of wildlife paintings display beautiful images of waterfowl in their natural environments. In 1934 the Federal Duck Stamp Program began and waterfowl stamps were issued to promote and raise funds for habitat conservation and responsible hunting. Later programs evolved with individual states, such as the Texas Duck Stamp and Print Program, which started in 1981 and successfully sold prints of the paintings used for the stamps. The Joe Staley donation of these prints includes many from this Texas program, although a few are from other state programs including Connecticut, North Carolina, Arkansas, Utah, and Alaska.</p> 
       <p>These prints also represent the best of wildlife artists in the U.S. featuring Larry Hayden, David Maass, Sherrie Russell Meline, and Ken Carlson among many others. All of these artists share a deep appreciation for nature that is evident in their attention to details and the lovingly crafted representations of their subjects. Have a look around and enjoy the unique views of waterfowl from all around the country.</p>

       <p>Drinking tea, visiting, and strolling through parks, all while impeccably dressed, these ladies exhibit the best of Victorian fashion from 1867-1900. At a time when any number of activities determined what to wear, the Victorian woman had a wardrobe suited for each occasion. There were different styles of dresses for walking, visiting, staying at home, and even for driving cars. Not to mention the accessories of hats, gloves, mantels, and parasols that were all a necessity. While the basics remained the same, fashions changed with the seasons and magazines such as Harper’s Bazar, The Season, and Mode Journal Wiener Chic were dedicated to keeping the Victorian woman up to date on the latest trends.</p> 
       <p>Take a stroll around the gallery and enjoy the magazines Victorian ladies pored over, perhaps while drinking tea, and be sure to note the variation of styles.</p>

       <p>A brilliant blue New Mexico sky dominated by scudding clouds is the backdrop for a view of the foothills in Joel Greene’s oil painting <em>Interesting Clouds</em>. Two colorful figures in bold Brazilian carnival masks stare straight ahead in Janet Stein Romero’s watercolor and gouache painting <em>Gemini Dancers</em>. Pueblo walls curving beneath a swirling sky evoke the ancient pueblo culture of New Mexico in Clayton Campbell’s oil on panel painting <em>Pueblo Viejo Triptych. </em></p> 
       <p>These paintings illustrate the diversity of the subject matter in the Third Invitational New Mexico Painters Exhibition at Highlands University that features 32 established and up-and-coming artists.</p> 
       <p>The free exhibition opens Sept. 25 in the Kennedy Alumni Hall, 905 University Ave., with a public opening reception from 4 – 7 p.m. The featured artist Clayton Campbell will deliver a gallery talk from 3:30 – 4 p.m.</p> 
       <p>“The greatest strength of this juried show, now in its third year, is the dependably high caliber of these New Mexico artists’ impressive work,” said James Mann, exhibit curator. “Collectively, these artists are reinventing the art of painting by recovering the ability to depict recognizable subject matter, which was abandoned with the rise of abstract art in in 1950s. They are part of a growing international movement which follows postmodernism.”</p> 
       <p>Mann, who curated more than 50 exhibitions from 1996 – 2005 for the Las Vegas Art Museum in Nevada, said most of the artwork in the Highlands exhibition employs figural rather than abstract representation.</p> 
       <p>“There is a broad range of thought-provoking subject matter representing contemporary life such as portraiture, landscapes, still-life, social interaction, biblical reference, interior spaces and commercial settings,” Mann said.</p> 
       <p>Many of the paintings will be available for purchase.</p> 
       <p>Robert Bell, a Santa Fe art collector, art patron, author and publisher, spearheaded the invitational exhibition for the third year. The Highlands Foundation collaborated with Bell to produce the exhibition. It continues through Nov. 10 and is open Monday – Friday 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. – 4 p.m.</p>

       <p>The exhibit features the work of the university’s Media Arts and Technology Department students and faculty as well as the Meadow City Camera Club.</p> 
       <p>“What’s wonderful about this collaboration is I felt inspired by looking at the media arts students’ work,” said Martha McCAffrey, Meadow City Camera Club member. “Their approach is often unique, and they bring a fresh eye to photography. The exhibit was a chance to learn from each other.”</p> 
       <p>McCaffrey, a photographer of 37 years, said the Meadow City Camera Club enjoyed working with the students, and wants to see the joint photography show become an annual event.</p> 
       <p>“I hope when people come to see this show they will experience a sense of unity between the community and the university,” McCaffrey said.</p> 
       <p>Kerry Loewen, chair of the Media Arts and Technology Department, said the photography exhibit showcases a variety of subject matter.</p> 
       <p>“This exhibit combines primarily landscape and abstract works from the camera club with works students in my contemporary photography class shot in the studio from spiders to people,” Loewen said.</p> 
       <p>Loewen said the exhibit gave his students the opportunity to prepare their work for display in a professional setting with professional photographers.</p> 
       <p>“This exhibit shows that our media arts students always rise to the challenge. I’m very proud of them. It’s also really nice to get students out of the classroom into the community,” Loewen said.</p> 
       <p>The <em>Town and Gown Photography Show</em> continues through May 27. It also features photographs by Highlands fine arts faculty.</p>

The initial edition of the book was published in 1997 following four seasons of visiting in the canyon with Lupita Litson McClanahan and her extended family. Photographed by Charles Winters, the book serves as a document of contemporary life, and is seen as a way&nbsp;&nbsp; of preserving images and stories for the next generation. The author/curator and photographer will present their work at a reception Nov. 23rd in Kennedy Hall Gallery.</p> 
       <p>Charles D. Winters is a photographer and cinematographer specializing in anthropology, nature, and the environment.

        <p>“This is a well-rounded art exhibit of Western Americana with a strong variety of oil and watercolor paintings, bronze sculptures, and drawings,” Sundt said. “In putting the show together, I looked for quality work with authenticity of detail. In some of the pieces, you can almost taste the dust, feel the rain, and hear the horses nickering. All the artists in this show have lived the cowboy life, and that’s their passion. The pieces portray the flavor, freedom and independence of being a cowboy and rancher.” &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nmhu.edu/art-exhibits-celebrate-cowboys-reunion-centennial-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more…</a></p>

One of the prodigious number of artists attracted to live and work in Santa Fe, Sinclair did both undergraduate and graduate work at the University of Connecticut. Twenty years later, he undertook three more years of study at the Portland (Maine) School of Art. He exhibited at a series of Santa Fe galleries, and a representative body of his paintings is a prominent part of this exhibition. Also a printmaker, he was a member of the Santa Fe Etching Club and was included in 100 Santa Fe Etchers (2008).</em></p>

       <p>If the New Mexico community of visual artists were an athletic team, one would have to say that it has a very deep bench. For a state with so small a population, the abundance of players and talent is genuinely remarkable. Of course, with Santa Fe and Taos widely known for their art colonies through most of the past century, this observation is not necessarily surprising. And New Mexico Highlands University itself had a period of deserved prominence in the 1960s when its studio art department drew students from across the U.S. to the campus. This chapter in the school’s history has been well documented by Elizabeth Orem in her book<em> A Fine Frenzy</em>, published jointly in 2013 by the NMHU Foundation and Bell Tower Editions of Santa Fe.</p> 
       <p>Why has New Mexico for so long produced, drawn, and fostered such a thriving population of artists? One has to answer that foremost is its unique geography. The breathtaking vastness of its vistas, embraced and uplifted by their abrupt walls of mountain ranges, together with a sky enormous beyond all description, are a landscape painter’s heavenly dream. The unceasing effort to capture and depict this grandeur has continued unbroken throughout an entire century, regardless of the various disruptions caused by abstraction in international art. But landscape painting could never be suppressed in New Mexico. The indomitable desire to represent the stirring of the human spirit caused by this unique geography is too strong to obey the dictates of artistic revolutions in distant capitals. The New Mexico-inspired response to such cosmopolitan developments is rooted in humanity’s instinctive drive to depict the world, too archetypal to be fenced in by changing artistic fashion.</p> 
       <p>Yet this exhibition includes far more than landscape art. Nearly all the other usual concerns of pictorial rendering are present. There are portraiture, still-life, cultural environments, eroticism, mythology, religion, social interaction, architecture, both treasured and everyday objects, animals, and machinery—to offer an incomplete list. And the variety of styles encompassed is equal to the number of artists exhibited. One of the incidental qualities of this exhibition is to demonstrate the endless possibilities in stylistic manner that the pictorial function presents. The imagination’s results for interpreting the visual appearance of things, places, and people are virtually unlimited. It is difficult to argue that abstraction can offer a comparable plenitude of different manners of expression and execution.</p> 
       <p>The number of dissimilar artists exhibited here is remarkable in itself, for an exhibition venue the size of Kennedy Hall. The enthusiastic response of the artists invited has been both authentic and amazing, and is a very encouraging sign for the future of such undertakings at Highlands. The first exhibition of like scope opened here last October on Homecoming Weekend. This was a representative selection from the Robert Bell and Eli Levin donations in 2013 of over 300 paintings to the NMHU Foundation as an artistic endowment of highly unusual extent for a university the size of Highlands. These donations established immediately an ample and eminent addition to this academic environment. The power of art to animate the human spirit will speak, through this growing collection and through further exhibitions like the First Invitational, both to present and future students and to the wider public alike.</p>
