     <h1>Diversity and Inclusion at Puget Sound</h1> 
     <p class="introduction">University of Puget Sound has a strong commitment to diversity as an essential foundation for a broad and stimulating liberal arts education. Numerous programs and resources engage the campus in an inclusive approach to celebrating, sharing, and supporting our journey together in an increasingly complex and multicultural world.</p>
     <h2>Diversity and Inclusion Vision</h2> 
     <p>We are a campus community that values the intrinsic worth of its members, recognizes our shared qualities, and embraces our differences. We make appreciation of all persons a key characteristic of this community, foster a spirit of openness and active engagement, and strive to be diverse and inclusive in every aspect of campus life. In doing so, we ensure a full educational opportunity for all who teach and learn at University of Puget Sound.</p> 
     <p>We believe that reflective, thoughtful, and respectful examination of the differing dimensions of diversity educates and empowers all who work and study here to be advocates for inclusion and equity. All members of this community share in cultivating, sustaining, and continuously developing an environment in which equity is intentionally sought and inclusiveness is practiced. The University of Puget Sound is a powerful example of a community enriched by diversity in all its forms, and the challenges and rewards that come with diverse representation, thought, and expression.</p>
