   <h2>Pandemic: One Year</h2> 
   <p><a href="https://elianthvia.tumblr.com/post/645579305650454528/pandemic-one-year" class="tumblr_blog" target="_blank">elianthvia</a>:</p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>When does the present become history, experience memory?</p>
    <p>A year ago, on March 10, 2020, we received <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.smith.edu/president-kathleen-mccartney/letters/2019-20/announcement-march-10-2020" target="_blank">an email from President McCartney</a> that marked the beginning of what we all know now as the pandemic world: students were sent home for remote learning, and we had to untangle all the mess during the extended spring break. One day later, WHO declares the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.</p>
    <p>The email to the community was sent out at 1:18 PM, two minutes before my anthropology class in Seelye started. I was walking briskly on Green Street from Tyler to Seelye, climbing a hill that went around the Neilson Library construction site, running late as usual, after having a spontaneous, joyful lunch conversation with someone on the topic of our favorite childhood cartoon shows (mine is Legend of Nezha that aired from 2003 to 2004). </p>
    <figure data-orig-width="1079" data-orig-height="1450" class="tmblr-full">
     <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/329fd17bcd23cdb2cb936c70b2fc4dd0/cf564554b3ce90fb-6c/s500x750/2d22b0c818f7f53be155b8e0b57179026e3a80e5.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1079" data-orig-height="1450" width="500" height="672">
    </figure>
    <p>The moment I walked into the classroom, I immediately sensed some strange air around me. Are people looking at me weirdly because I am late to class again? I thought to myself, half blushed. As I froze at the entrance, a girl rushed out of the classroom holding her phone and started sobbing. I also saw another girl down the hall talking to someone on the phone, her eyes red and watery. Perplexed, I walked into the classroom and settled down in the seat where I usually sat. Then, I whispered to the person sitting next to me: What happened? “Have you checked your email?” She asked. Still dizzy and out of breath from sprinting to class, I pulled out my phone instinctively and saw the headline of the email notification. My heart sank. We were kicked out. </p>
    <p>The rest of the day was a blur. What I learned from the lecture I don’t remember; I only remember the prof expressing his frustration and the look on students’ faces that showed their minds elsewhere. Having just returned to the states from China, the then-epicenter, I was having a major déjà vu. A day later, I wrote: “I saw it coming. But when the eviction finally hits, I am still overwhelmed. I’ve kind of been preparing for this mentally [after Amherst announced their plan to evict students], but I know I am never mentally ready to deal with this. [Keeping myself distracted is] the only thing that drags me away from the edge of insanity. I need to be busy.“&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Since the start of Spring 2020, I had been trying to keep myself busy and staying engaged. It was mid-March when I finally got a good sense of my schedule and figured out how everything worked. I knew what assignments I was supposed to turn in each week by heart, where I needed to be for practice without a reminder, when my work shift started, and who I could hang out with on the weekend. Suddenly all aspects of my life came to a pause.</p>
    <p>It was only my second semester at Smith. The flowers outside Northrop-Gillet were budding. The New England earth was coming back to life after its long wintry slumber. Spring was so close, but I had to wave goodbye to it all. </p>

   <h2>Spring 2021</h2>

   <blockquote>
    <p>I’m finally back on campus and taking classes again, and I’m so excited. Most of my classes are primarily remote still, but I’m happy to at least live on campus.</p>
    <p>My classes this spring are:</p>
    <p><b>BIO 366 Biogeography - </b>This class fulfills requirements for my biology major as well as for my 5 College Coastal and Marine Sciences certificate, and its a class I’ve been wanting to take since my first year. It is about the distribution of species on Earth, both terrestrial and marine, and how humans are impacting those habitats.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>BIO 390 Coral Reef Seminar - </b>This seminar I’ve also been waiting to take, and I’m so excited to finally be in it. It also fills the same requirements as my biogeography class, so I’m almost done with my major and certificate (ahhhh!) As the name suggests we study coral reefs with an emphasis on reading and presenting relevant scientific papers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>REL 206 Afterlife in World Religions - </b>I’m taking full advantage of Smith’s open curriculum and taking a class way out of my field about religion! I’ve never taken anything in the religion department before, but so far I’m really engaged with the readings and the professors are making it very accessible. I was not raised with any sort of religion so I’m excited to learn more.</p>
    <p><b>CLS - Bronze Age Archaeology in the Mediterranean - </b>I officially finished my archaeology minor last spring, but I really liked the professor who taught Hellenistic Art and Archaeology so when I saw she was teaching an even more archaeology focused class I had to take it. We’re studying the civilizations of Sumer, Ancient Egypt and more up to the Bronze Age collapse.&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>First Two Weeks: Food, Classes, and Trevor Noah</h1>
    <p>Made it through the first two weeks of Spring 2021 and the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.smith.edu/covid19/initial-operating-mode" target="_blank">initial operating mode</a>! Hello March and goodbye Blue Mode!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The start of the semester was like a whirlwind. The strangeness, excitement and novelty of this hybrid semester took me a bit to get used to, especially since I am living on campus with covid restrictions.</p>

    <p><b>Different Food, Same Food&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p>Today (Feb 28, almost March!) is the last day of the Blue Mode, so food is still for take-out only. In a normal year, students go to the dining hall of their choice to have meals. As of now, however, we order food using <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grubhub.com%2F&amp;t=YjVlNThlMTBhYWJmMzYxZDhhMjcyODFlZDg2MmNkNWYwYTYxMjViNixmMDcwMzk5NzhkMGJlMzUzNDc1YzdmMjg4MDFiOTA2NTg1ZGRkYjJh&amp;ts=1614554160" target="_blank">Grubhub</a>. The app gives us several dining hall options that each have their own menu. We can customize our meal order on Grubhub, and the app will notify us once the food is ready. We then pick up our food packed in paper bags and eat in our rooms. Just like a real restaurant, the dining halls only open during certain hours. Because the menu rarely changes, some students invented monikers for each dining hall in accordance with the cuisine. Here are some examples just for fun: Cutter Ziskind - McDonald, Tyler - Pizza Hut, King Scales - Taco Bell, Lamont - Chiptole, Comstock - Panda Express, Chuckett - Panera. (Note: Dawes Gluten-Free Dining and Kosher Kitchen are not included in the list above, but they are open too.)</p>

    <p>Positively, thanks to the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.smith.edu/covid19/health-safety/coronavirus-screening" target="_blank">low positivity rate</a> on campus, some academic buildings have been open to OneCard holders already. So in the past few days instead of eating in my room, I’ve been going to Seelye by myself to eat in an empty classroom. I also noticed that the staff have been setting up tables in the dining hall for social distanced (can we call it physical distanced instead?) seating in preparation for Green Mode which starts on <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.smith.edu/covid19/to-the-community/updates/march-1-change-to-green-mode" target="_blank">March 1st</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Spring 2012</b> <b>Classes </b></p>
    <p>While I eat in the classrooms, I study and attend classes in my room (which is kind of … weird??). This semester I am taking a total of 21 credits, which include three classes to fulfill the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.smith.edu/academics/engineering/major" target="_blank">requirements for the engineering major</a>: PHY 210: Math Methods for Physicists and Engineers, EGR 220: Circuit Theory and CHM 222: Organic Chemistry. On why I chose to take the notoriously hard chemistry class as my lab science, the decision making process of which took a good couple of weeks, one: I like challenging classes, two: I want to explore the field of chemistry and the possibility of being a chemical engineer, and three: a lot of my unbiased chemistry major/ minor friends recommended it and told me they had fun; I believed them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For circuits and orgo, I received a lab kit and a model kit (a semi-fair compensation for online labs?). Both classes are demanding and the online labs are sometimes confusing and frustrating. I turn to find solace in drawing the hexagons in organic molecules and rectangles in circuits.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Classes I am taking just for fun:&nbsp; CLS 227: Classical Mythology, IDP 132: Designing Your Path, and MUS 924Y: Second Year Performance.&nbsp;</p>
    <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3024" data-orig-width="4032">

    <p><b>An Evening with Trevor Noah</b></p>
    <p>Last Tuesday, all students were invited to a live virtual event: <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.amherst.edu/news/calendar/node/794287" target="_blank">An Evening with Trevor Noah: A Moderated Q&amp;A with Heidi Gardner</a>. I am just throwing out some highlights here. Blogger’s favorite line: If you’re crazy alone, you’re just crazy; if you’re crazy with a bunch of other people, you’re having fun. Trevor’s definition of growing up: A mini drunk person getting sober. A piece of advice for future leaders: Listen to the voices of the people you are leading; be decisive; acknowledge when you’re wrong, accept criticism, and know to differentiate between haters and critics. The Q&amp;A session was a nice, short study break on a busy weeknight.</p>
    <p>Virtual events are better than no events, but nothing beats in-person activities. I really look forward to finally moving to Green Mode!</p>

    <p><b>Blogger’s Note</b></p>
    <p>Just knowing myself, after I post something I will be frantically proofreading and re-re-re-editing it about every 3 hours over the next 24 hours (no I don’t wake up in the middle of the night to check Tumblr; time is figurative, you get the idea). Then I will get tired of squinting at my own writing and move on. Still, nothing is perfect and all writing can be improved. So if you are reading my blog&nbsp;(oh hi there AI! Did you pass the Turing test today?) right after I post it, chances are that you are going to spot some typos that hopefully will disappear in the next couple of hours! You’ve been warned of bad writing 😈.</p>

    <p>Smith went into green mode today (explanation of operation modes<i> <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.smith.edu/covid19/operating-modes" target="_blank">here</a></i>), and this is exciting because while we still don’t have access to the Campus Cafe or Neilson Library quite yet, those are coming in the near future! Not only that, but we can now use common spaces in houses! Living rooms, kitchens - we can even have up to two guests in our rooms!</p>

    <p>This sounds like my life is very sad and, well, while that’s accurate to an extent (look at me go, a whole comedian), the bar has been set <i>pretty</i>&nbsp;low by COVID-19; for good reason! But since humans are social animals, we’ve all taken a bit of a hit because of social distancing, and getting crumbs of our lives back feels like an incredible achievement. It wasn’t even as unusual as starting to see people back on campus! I think I already had that&nbsp;‘culture shock’ a few weeks ago, and my brain got used to it enough to miss genuine interactions with both Smith College, the people,&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;Smith College, the place.</p>
    <p><i>[I would just like to present a brief intermission of how the paragraph above perfectly illustrates how ADHD works in my brain. Moving on-]</i></p>
    <p>As a short Day In My Life Now That Everything’s Excited Because We’re In Green Mode, I woke up (didn’t oversleep! was very proud), did a little bit of bullet journaling (which I haven’t gotten round to in ages and was missing dearly!), got dinner, went to an amazing Presidential Colloquium about Black Futures, did some work and am currently studying into the night in my little corner of Wilder House.</p>

    <p>hi! I am an ED 2025 student and I really want to double major in Computer Science and maybe Gov (or business its undecided ahaha but I know I wanna do comp sci!) Could you please give some insight on the Computer Science major at smith? Is it hard to manage with other majors and is there anything you should know before starting the major? Thank you!</p>

     <p>Hi!</p>
     <p>First off, congrats on getting into &amp; choosing Smith! Second off, I’ll have to say that Smith doesn’t exactly have a business major? There are ways to get involved with business and entrepreneurship and UMass, one of the colleges in the 5 College Consortium, is pretty well-known for business! I think we might also offer a Certificate in the field, but don’t quote me on that.</p>
     <p>In more general terms, there’s no need to put pressure on yourself in deciding on a major, especially before you’ve started college! But also, yes, I can give as much insight into the CS major as I can! Personally, I am a Computer Science major and an English major, and I’ve found that CS paired with a Humanities/non-STEM major works pretty well in terms of workload and diversity in assignments. However, if you choose to go the way of interweaving two STEM majors, there’s also some really cool aspects of that: some of the classes overlap, and there’s a lot of interesting higher-level classes you can take that combine, like, Biology and CS or something like that!</p>
     <p>In terms of things to know before starting the major, I’d probably advise you to plan to take a lot of your junior &amp; senior year classes at UMass especially if you want to take several courses on one topic (robotics, AI, etc) - no worries though, that means access to better dining!</p>
     <p>For anything else, feel free to submit another question anytime! Or reply to this post. Always down to talk heh :D</p>

    <p>hi! i was accepted to smith for the class of '24, very exciting:) stumbled across ur blog &amp; wanted to ask abt ur experience at smith so far! ill also be an international student, so im curious abt ur perspective coming into smith as a first year. how was getting situated? is it hard to get into the swing of things? just whatever thoughts (good &amp; bad) u've had abt your months there.. id love to hear!!</p>

     <p>Helloooooo!!</p>
     <p>I think this one’s been sitting here awhile so, sorry whoever sent this! Didn’t get the notification for some reason? Anyways, getting to answering the actual question: my experience so far has been mostly positive! Getting situated was easy, but that’s more so for personal reasons if that makes sense? I really wanted to get out of my country &amp; that conservative environment so anywhere not-there was good for me.</p>
     <p>Getting into the swings of things… is a journey. I wouldn’t say it’s either hard or easy - it definitely takes time, and there’s ups and downs along the way. One day it’ll feel like you’ve immediately belonged and others, that no one likes you and you’re alone in the world. Most likely outcome is that neither of these will happen, but that you’ll find your people that make you feel like home.</p>
     <p>One thing I’m <i>still</i>&nbsp;not over though? The food. Food in the US just tastes different - bad different, almost like you’re tasting said food in 144p. I’ve had a couple of international friends confirm this for me, but even Snickers bars and fast food tastes… <i>less</i>.</p>
     <p>But yeah, again, it’s been mostly fun! Quarantine’s made it less fun, and I can’t wait for time to become real again, but it’s been way better than it would’ve been if I weren’t here!</p>

    <p>What are the bathrooms in the houses like?</p>
   </div> 
   <div class="caption">
    <p>Hi prospective student! Most students will have shared hallway bathrooms with shower stalls and toilet stalls. There is usually a counter of shared sinks too and trash cans, but you will need to bring your own hand towel and sometimes your own soap! There is also usually a single stall bathroom in each house or even on each floor for people who need more space or prefer privacy. Triple rooms usually have their own bathroom that you would be responsible for cleaning yourself. That being said, everyone does their part to keep the shared bathrooms nice and clean.</p>

    <p>hello!! i’m applying to transfer for fall 2021 and would be arriving on campus as a junior. i’m super excited at the idea of attending a school like smith, but i’m wondering what it’s like for transfers. is it easy to meet people? / how do you meet people as a transfer? thanks in advance xx </p>
   </div> 
   <div class="caption">
    <p>Hi! I am so excited for you to be applying to Smith! Smith has some pretty amazing programs for transfer students. A few of my friends are transfer students and the first place to make friends would be from participating in orientation programs. All new students have tons of activities and I know many people that formed some initial friendships from their orientation group. After orientation, the next support system would be the Head of New Students (or HONS) in your house (here is a <a href="https://smithbysmithies.tumblr.com/post/177240409035/what-it-means-to-be-a-hons" target="_blank">link</a> to some info about HONS). Part of your HONS would do is plan activities for all new students to introduce them to each other and the house community. I would say that the Smith community is so welcoming to everyone no matter when you enter. I think that Smithies love meeting new people and see any time as a time to make a new friend. Outside of the few ways I talked about, I would also suggest using social media and just messaging someone that you would like to hang out with (I personally love when people do this, and when I have done this the responses have always been positive). Another cool thing is to reach out to people in your classes for studying– you already have something in common and then you can get to know them while studying. My last tip would be joining student orgs! There are so many from cultural organizations to tour guiding or even ghost hunting (info about student orgs linked <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.smith.edu/student-life/clubs-and-organizations" target="_blank">here</a>). Joining an org is another great way to meet people who you have at least one connection with! I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I just wrote out basically the entirety of this post, and then refreshed the page by instinct and lost everything. Lesson learned: save your posts as drafts consistently. Here we go again!</p>
    <p>I’ve noticed a few more of you around here since my last post, and whether you’re current/prospective/not Smithies, I’d love to hear from y’all! My ask box is always open, same with my PMs. Like many of us, I’ll take almost any form of human interaction during these dystopian times.</p>

    <p>Anyway, classes! Today is the Monday of my second week of classes, and I realized I hadn’t made a post about my first week of classes! Important context before I get there, though, is that so far throughout this pandemic, I haven’t really been able to just sit down and focus on my classes; there was always something else more urgent, whether it be Trump trying to deport all international students (a scare that happened twice over the summer!), me coming out to my parents, or dealing with some pretty terrible personal stuff towards the end of 2020.</p>
    <p>I’m not saying this as an&nbsp;‘<i>oh my life is SO hard</i>’ but as a way to show the reasons for which I was feeling like I was slipping on my academics. And so, I knew that going into my fourth Smith semester (that feels unreal to type, woah), I wanted/needed to change something, for my own mental stability.</p>

   <h2>my spring 2021 schedule</h2>

   <blockquote>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>Since the semester has already started and I have now completed more than a week of the semester, I decided to mix how my first week went and my course schedule together into one post.</p>
    <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="823" data-orig-width="842">
     <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b0da0936d37281677476c25b999c670e/b719f65abbb2f965-63/s500x750/cea641684c48fe0bacea65c8b934f5490be3bc0b.jpg" data-orig-height="823" data-orig-width="842" width="500" height="489" alt="image">
    </figure>
    <p>Here is my schedule for the semester!</p>
    <p>This semester I am taking 5 courses, with a total of 18 credits.</p>
    <p>The courses are:</p>
    <p>-&nbsp; CHINESE II (INTENSIVE) / CHI 221 (5 credits)</p>
    <p>-&nbsp; CLQ: POLITICS US MEX BORDER / GOV 237 (4 credits)</p>
    <p>- COMPUTER GRAPHICS / CSC 240 (4 credits)</p>
    <p>-&nbsp; CLQ:WOMEN&amp; NARRATION/MOD KOREA / EAL 273 (4 credits)</p>
    <p>-&nbsp; DRAWING SOCIAL JUSTICE / ARS 153 (1 credit)</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>For my computer science major, I decided to only take one course this semester since the other course I wanted to take clashed with my Chinese class. I have been taking Chinese since my first semester at Smith and I have really been enjoying learning a new language, therefore I decided to continue learning it this semester. Since I was no longer taking another comp sci course this semester, I decided to take courses in other interests that I have. I took a course last semester called Latin American Political Systems, and since I really liked the professor and the content, I decided to take another one of her classes, which is the Politics of the US Mexico Border. And finally I decided to take a course on Women and Narration in Korea because I really like films and it is a subject matter that I’ve never learned about.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>I really like Smith’s open curriculum because it allows me to explore subjects that I’ve never been exposed to. I’ve taken a wide range of courses and subject matters already despite the fact that this is only my 4th semester here.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>My first week kind of felt unexpected. Usually my first week of classes at Smith are more chill and professors give students time to&nbsp;“shop” for courses (which just means the period of time students attend courses and decide whether or not they want to stay in the class or sign up for a different class). The first week is also relaxed in order to give students enough time to buy any required material for the course. This week however started off rather quickly, which I will attribute it to the fact that, due to the pandemic, this semester is an accelerated semester. I’m sure professors just want to start early so that they can cover as much material as possible in a shorter time frame.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>I am fortunate to only have needed to buy two textbooks, which were both for my Chinese course. My professors for my other courses are super generous and have supplied free pdfs of whatever readings they want us to do. As a low income student, this is super helpful for me, especially during a pandemic! I can say super lucky because I know how expensive it can be to buy all required material.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>After completing a week of courses, I feel like I won’t be changing my schedule. The courses I’m taking this semester genuinely interest me and I’m excited to learn more about each subject matter! :)</p>

    <p>Hello Friends,&nbsp;<b><br></b></p>
    <p>Here in Noho, us Smithies are just finishing up our first week of classes! In honor of finishing this first week I wanted to share a day in my life post for the first day of classes. Before we start, I also wanted to show you all my desk setup since this is where all of the magic happens.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>MORNING</b></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p><b>8:00 am: </b>Good morning! I am on the track team so my day started with a lift from 8:00 am to 8:45 am, this is something that I will be doing every Monday and Friday for the entire semester. It usually struggle with getting up, but since it was the first day, I had the first day jitters and didn’t have much difficulty getting up.&nbsp;<br></p>
     <p><b>9:00 am: </b>After I finished lifting, I headed up the road to Tyler. Right now we are ordering all of our meals through GrubHub and you are able to grab and go once your meal is ready. I think I had to wait about 15 minutes for my breakfast to be done that day.&nbsp;</p>
     <p><b>9:15 am:</b> There are a few public spaces that we are allowed to eat in, but I usually eat in my room and listen to a podcast or talk to friends and family. One of my friends put me on to NPR’s<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.npr.org/lifekit" target="_blank"> Life Kit podcast</a> and now I am putting you all on! After my breakfast I also like to spend some time writing in my journal really about anything that comes to my mind. I try to do this frequently (not every single morning), but on the mornings that I feel like it.&nbsp;</p>

     <p><b>9:35 am:</b> After breaking my fast I took a nice shower and really took my time to get ready. Some mornings I rush, but I wanted to feel extra good for the first day.</p>
     <p><b>10:55 am:</b> Finally, the golden time! This is when my first class, PSY269: Categorization and Intergroup Behavior started! This is a psychology course and some of the main things we will be discussing will be prejudice, discrimination and other things related to how groups interact with each other. I really enjoyed our first class.&nbsp;</p>
     <p><b>12:00 pm: </b>Class finished a bit early this day, so after I went and grabbed lunch with my friends. I was able to snap a picture of my lunch and this meal is the Indian Curry Bowl from Lamont. I think they are pretty good and probably get this meal for lunch or dinner at least once a week. I usually like to have something to look at or listen to while I eat and on this day I watched Youtube and Facetimed a friend.</p>

    <p><b>AFTERNOON</b></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p><b>1:40 pm:</b> After lunch, I started my next class, AFR117: History of African American People to 1960. I also loved this class. We reviewed the syllabus and did a small breakout room activity where we looked at a few quotes and discussed what we thought about them. I think the quote my group looked at was really important so I will share it here. Let me know if you have any thoughts about it or questions about what I thought. Here it is:<b><i> “This history continues to be mistaken by some as a burden when it should instead be recognized as a tremendous responsibility.” –Peniel Joseph</i></b></p>
     <p><b>3:15 pm:</b> I had my next class, PSY 202: Research Methods for Psychology. I have taken a class with this professor in the past and I really enjoyed it. Research Methods is also required for the psychology major, so that is part of the reason I am taking this class too.</p>
     <p><b>4:30 pm:</b> Once my Research Methods class ended I had a bit of time until dinner! I will use this time to let you all know that most classes (except labs and maybe a few others) last for an hour and 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>EVENING</b></p>
    <blockquote>
     <p><b>5:00 pm:</b> There is a big dinner rush at five and I contribute to it. The most popular dining halls for dinner right now are Tyler and Comstock. This night I had pizza for dinner!&nbsp;</p>
     <p><b>7:05 pm:</b> After dinner, I had my final class AFR289: Race, Feminism, and Resistance in Movements for Social Change. The professor for this class is amazing and I was so excited to take another one of their classes! This class–and pretty much all of my classes are discussion-based. We all came to class having read a<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F10%2F13%2Fopinion%2Fmegan-thee-stallion-black-women.html&amp;t=MGEwZTdiYjZkMTMyNzBiMmE2MzI4MDhmMDcwYTcxZmI2YWJhZWIxZCxSQUtKV1pOSg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3A69ewxe8UaubLCBz_x9dHjA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fsmithbysmithies.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F643761209658802176%2Fspend-the-day-with-me-first-day-edition&amp;m=1&amp;ts=1615943060" target="_blank"> piece</a> by Meg thee Stallion and we discussed this as well as the syllabus and other things to expect from the class.&nbsp;</p>
     <p><b>8:20 pm: </b>Finally, at 8:20 pm I was finished with all of my classes. I *try* to stop doing school work at 8:30 pm (although it does not always happen), so I was done for the night. I listened to some music, brushed my teeth and did my other night activities and was off to bed! That was my day!</p>

    <p>Thank you, my loves for sticking with me in this post! I am so looking forward to the rest of this semester and I hope that you all are excited too. I am sending you my good energies. Chat soon. Tootles.</p>
