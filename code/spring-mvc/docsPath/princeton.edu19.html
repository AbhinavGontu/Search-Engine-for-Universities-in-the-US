              <h2>Policy</h2> 
              <h3>1. &nbsp;Acceptable Use</h3> 
              <h4>a. &nbsp;Institutional Use</h4> 
              <p>Use of all University information technology and digital resources should be for purposes that are consistent with the non-profit educational mission and the policies and legal requirements (including license agreements and terms of service) of the University, and not for commercial purposes.</p> 
              <h4>b. &nbsp;Personal Use</h4> 
              <p>Personal use of the University’s information technology and digital resources, except for students enrolled at the University, should be incidental and kept to a minimum.</p> 
              <h4>c. &nbsp;Prohibited Use</h4> 
              <p>Use of the University’s information technology and digital resources should not violate applicable federal, state, and local law, including U. S. copyright law, or applicable University policies, and, if travel is involved, the laws of the relevant nation or state. From any location, University resources may not be used to transmit malicious, harassing, or defamatory content.&nbsp;Because of privacy, compliance and legal considerations, the University prohibits the use of its electronic services, equipment&nbsp;and systems (collectively, “IT Systems") in&nbsp;recording non-public University meetings, activities&nbsp;and events except when recording is necessary to facilitate University operations and serve institutional needs. For examples of recordings that serve institutional needs, please see the Guidelines for Compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy.</p> 
              <h4>d. &nbsp;Political Use</h4> 
              <p>As a 501(c)(3) organization, the University is prohibited from participating or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate for public office, and no substantial part of the University’s activities may be directed to influencing legislation (i.e. lobbying).&nbsp; Individuals may not use University technological resources for political purposes in a manner that suggests the University itself is participating in campaign or political activity or fundraising, or for influencing legislation.&nbsp; Any other use with respect to political activity must be permitted by applicable University policy and consistent with applicable laws.</p> 
              <h3>2. &nbsp;Access and Privacy</h3> 
              <p>The University has the legal right, to access, preserve and review all information stored on or transmitted through its electronic services, equipment and systems.&nbsp; The University endeavors to afford reasonable privacy for individual users, and does not access information created and/or stored by individual users on its IT Systems except when it determines that it has a legitimate operational need to do so.&nbsp; For the applicable policy relating to access please see the <a href="https://oit.princeton.edu/policies/access-accounts">Policy on Access to Accounts and Information</a>.</p> 
              <h3>3. &nbsp;Protection of University Resources</h3> 
              <p>Users of University information technology and digital resources are responsible for protecting University data, including its confidentiality, integrity, access, retention and disposal, in accordance with the University’s Information Security Policy (<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/oit/it-policies/it-security-policy">www.princeton.edu/oit/it-policies/it-security-policy</a>), Record Retention Policy, (<a href="https://records.princeton.edu/">records.princeton.edu</a>) and other applicable University policies.&nbsp; Individuals with University accounts or administrative or custodial responsibility over any University resources should take reasonable measures to protect these accounts and resources. &nbsp;Shared University technological resources should be used for educational purposes and to carry out the legitimate business of the University, and should not be used in a way that disrupts or otherwise interferes with any University activities or systems, or that is inconsistent with the University’s policies or goals.&nbsp;</p> 
              <h3>4. &nbsp;Violations and Penalties</h3> 
              <p>Violations of the policy may result in disciplinary action, including dismissal from employment, expulsion from further study and termination, or suspension of network privileges.&nbsp;</p>
