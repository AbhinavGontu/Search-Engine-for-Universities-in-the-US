  <h2>The global uprooting of lives since the COVID-19 pandemic struck has been so sweeping that an effort to highlight people who have gone to extraordinary lengths in helping their communities is surely daunting.</h2> 
  <p style="width:80%;">It may be that the more difficult task is to identify those among us who <em>haven’t</em> gone well beyond what is typically demanded. </p> 
  <p style="width:80%;">Some have invented new ways, on the fly, to continue to meet day-to-day commitments. Some have quit jobs to care for children and to oversee their children’s schooling. Some have lost jobs—and found ways to serve their communities, despite their own economic stresses. And some have carried on while shouldering the grief of the sudden and unforeseen death of a loved one. </p> 
  <p style="width:80%;">We’ve been collecting these stories for months. As of this writing, the cases of COVID-19 are surging in many parts of the world, including in the United States and in Rochester. Circumstances continue to change and are changing for many of the people featured here. What is certain is that most of them continue to find the demands of their work expanding exponentially—or they are continuing to volunteer to make it so. </p> 
  <p style="width:80%;">There are many others we might have included. If you know of others in the University community who belong among this group, please write to us at <a href="mailto:rochrev@rochester.edu" style="color:#fff;">rochrev@rochester.edu</a>, with “Rochester Responds” in the subject line.</p>

The vaccine efforts at Rochester included phase 3 trials, the final stage of development of a vaccine before FDA approval.</p>

  <p>When students headed home in March, twin sisters Destinee Bell ’21 and Deziree Bell ’21 did, too—only they kept coming back.

Throughout the spring and summer, they were among about 30 students who stayed on as staff of Wilson Commons Student Activities.</p>
  <p>From March through the summer, Destinee (left) and Deziree commuted from their family home in nearby Gates, New York, to help fellow students who could not return home. </p> <a href="students-stay-to-help.html" class="button read">Read More</a>

  <h2>Balancing acts</h2> 
  <p>For faculty members and students alike, the pandemic has blurred the lines between work and home and between the professional and the private. During the spring 2020 semester, Molly Ball (pictured), a lecturer in the history department, and her husband, Pablo Sierra Silva, an assistant professor of history, found themselves juggling teaching schedules as well as schooling for their three children, aged 2, 5, and 8. The couple split their home into two zones—a downstairs home school and an upstairs “uni chauqita,” or “little university,” off limits to the kids, where Ball and Sierra Silva conducted their classes. </p>
