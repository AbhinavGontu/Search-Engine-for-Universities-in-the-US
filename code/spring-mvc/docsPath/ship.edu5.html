   <h1 class="top">Our Commitment:</h1> 
   <p>Pennsylvania’s State System of Higher Education (State System) is committed to high ethical standards and the enforcement of policies, procedures, and legal requirements. The concerns of employees, students, and others within the university communities regarding matters of wrongdoing are important; therefore, an incident reporting system has been established as a means to confidentially identify situations believed to be inappropriate. Examples comprise, but are not limited to, abuse, improper conduct, policy violations, financial matters including theft and fraud, ethical concerns, legal violations, intercollegiate athletics violations, environmental health and safety issues, etc.</p> 
   <p>Use of the Incident Reporting System is not intended to take the place of existing reporting mechanisms and processes established at each university, for concerns related to:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>academic matters, such as grade appeals, curriculum structure, and teaching effectiveness which shall be addressed through the proper academic process;</li> 
    <li>employment disputes, such as those governed under collective bargaining agreements, which shall be addressed through human resources offices; </li> 
    <li>reporting of crimes on campus which shall be made directly to university police departments; and,</li> 
    <li>matters dealing with harassment, sexual harassment, and discrimination which shall be addressed pursuant to Board of Governors’ Policy 2009-03: Social Equity.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>The State System has selected EthicsPoint (NAVEX Global) to provide an incident reporting system. Reports submitted through EthicsPoint will be handled timely, discreetly, and in an appropriate manner. The State System’s Office of Internal Audit and Risk Assessment will receive reported information from EthicsPoint with necessary facts being shared only with those individuals essential for the investigation and resolution of potential concerns. The information you provide will be sent to us by EthicsPoint on a totally confidential and anonymous basis if you should choose.</p> 
   <p>EthicsPoint and the State System are committed to safeguarding the confidentiality of information received. Materials will be securely governed as work product materials of the Office of Internal Audit and Risk Assessment. No retaliatory actions will be taken against anyone for reporting or inquiring in good faith about potential concerns of State System operations.</p>
