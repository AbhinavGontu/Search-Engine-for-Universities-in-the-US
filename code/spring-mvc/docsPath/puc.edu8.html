     <div class="entry-content"> 
      <p>by Becky St. Clair</p> 
      <p>The history of American music is infused with African influence, and it covers a multitude of genres, styles, artists, and composers. In&nbsp;<a href="https://music.si.edu/story/musical-crossroads">an article on the Smithsonian Institute website</a>, Steven Lewis says, “Describing the African-American influence on American music in all its glory and variety is an intimidating–if not impossible–task. African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.”</p> 
      <p>And yet the standard music course at most American colleges and universities rarely, if ever, touches on Black Music.</p> 
      <p>“I’ve spent my life listening to classic jazz, gospel, spirituals, and oldies, but I didn’t tap into the juggernaut of African-American classical music until I got to PUC,” remembers Christina Allen, 2019 PUC music and visual arts alumna. “When I started looking for recital pieces in my voice lessons, I realized there are so many classically trained African-American composers, lyricists, and artists, and I’d never heard of them.”</p> 
      <p>Allen has always been a singer; her father, also a singer as well as a trombonist, began teaching her jazz harmonies when she was five years old. She was handed a mic and soloed with her church choir as a young child, too.</p> 
      <p>“When I got to PUC, though I was focused on film and television, I couldn’t help but find my way over to the music department,” she says with a grin.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Allen found her way to a practice room and began singing. She was overheard by a professor, who encouraged her to try out for choir, which she did. At first it was just something she was adding to her course lineup for fun, but she quickly realized it was more than that to her.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>“I loved it,” Allen admits. “I knew I had to get a degree in music because I just love it, it’s part of who I am, and I wanted to study it properly.”</p> 
      <p>During her senior year, as she prepared for her senior recital with Dr. Eve-Anne Wilkes, her voice instructor, Allen knew she wanted to include music by Black composers in her lineup. So she chose a couple of pieces by William Grant Still:&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2S9jbYMYn8vpFJl3auQGcT?si=mDSUMGf4TICTJj1absx8aQ">“The Breath of a Rose,”</a>&nbsp;with lyrics by Langston Hughes, and&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3dUZ0gwt1iQShU0w3DM5EM?si=DaA1GaheRQa4Zw8IqVb7kA">“Grief,”</a>&nbsp;music set to a poem by LeRoy V. Grant.</p> 
      <p>“Still’s music has been instrumental in my journey as an African-American female vocalist,” Allen says. “There’s something really incredible about the storytelling in it. The way he brings together the music just has such a powerful way of emoting stories that are really relevant to our culture. He gets under your skin in a good way, with room for thought and consideration.”</p> 
      <p>Allen points out that Still was extremely thoughtful about the lyrics of his music and about who he had write them.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>“His music speaks to the experience he and everyone around him was having, and that’s meaningful to me,” Allen adds. “Even with current artists in popular genres, the ones I gravitate toward are those who are using their talent for more than just entertainment. They have something to contribute to the time they’re in.”</p> 
      <p><strong>Ambassador Status</strong></p> 
      <p>It isn’t just Still that speaks to Allen; she also proclaims a deep and abiding love for the music of Florence Price, George Walker, Robert Nathaniel, and Margaret Bonds. And though her counterparts at HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities) studied these and others in every music class they took, Allen points out that at most colleges and universities, you have to search out specific classes about Black or African-American music.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>“It’s just not common literature,” she says with sadness. “There are brilliant composers from every ethnicity and we simply don’t hear about them. If we as a society want to heal in some of these areas in which we’ve been wounded and broken, we have to rethink how we educate. Because education is how we cultivate our values and mindsets and it shapes our perspectives of the world.”</p> 
      <p>Allen is a classically trained African-American female vocalist. Though there are many others who fit this description around the world, she knows she is still a rarity. And she feels compelled to be an ambassador for her culture–specifically for women of her culture–in classical music.</p> 
      <p>“It would be an injustice if I didn’t,” she says. “If someone is moved by the fact that the music I sing was made by someone who looks like me, I’ve done what I’m supposed to do. My voice is a gift and I have a responsibility to share that gift. I’m not just singing when I perform; I’m telling the story of African-American music–of classical music–and I want to share that story because if I don’t, I don’t know if anyone else will.”</p> 
      <p>Allen quickly points out, however, that she and her African-American brothers and sisters are not the only ones who can tell this story. For example, white people are not the only ones allowed to tell the story of Mozart or Bach or Debussy; Allen herself has told their stories and others throughout her musical career.</p> 
      <p>“We should be able to tell each other’s stories,” she says with feeling. “Anyone of any race, creed, shape, size, color, or whatever should tell whatever story they resonate with and that resonates with them. In telling the story and sharing, it’s a fight for equality. We have importance just like everyone else, and there’s value in that.”</p> 
      <p>It is, however, a special honor for Allen, as a Black musician, to honor the legacy of those who have gone before her. And it’s not just about singing music; it’s also talking about it.</p> 
      <p><strong>Sharing Culture</strong></p> 
      <p>Allen shares a story of chatting with a nurse at a doctor’s appointment. The nurse happened to mention that he’d been to Scotland, going back to his roots. Allen’s immediate response was, “That music is so soulful! I love it!” The nurse was taken aback by her description of Scottish music, surprised that she had not only listened to it, but had thoughtful things to say about it.</p> 
      <p>“We started talking about music and how it impacts our lives,” Allen recalls. “It turns out he has a radio station and loves music, listening to everything under the sun. I started sharing about composers I love from my own culture that had impacted me and he said he’d play some of them on his station.”</p> 
      <p>Intrigued and inspired, Allen tuned into the station later and found the nurse had kept his word. He even gave her a shout-out on-air.</p> 
      <p>“It’s so important that we share each other’s culture,” Allen emphasizes. “All of it shapes each of us, and if we claim to want equality and do away with racism on every level, we need to walk that talk.”</p> 
      <p>And it starts with education.</p> 
      <p>“We have to integrate our history courses,” Allen says. “Branching out and offering the history of Black music not just as a separate course, but as part of the history of music we already take.”</p> 
      <p>She continues by saying that classes shouldn’t just talk about African music in world music courses, but in all of them, and when studying composition, professors should be thoughtful to include a diverse range of cultures and styles. Lectures should Include Black composers and musicians, and ensembles should perform music from all over the world.</p> 
      <p>“For many–myself included–college is the first time we truly experience classical music,” Allen asserts. “If not for some awesome teachers, I may not have had the experience I did with classical music. There’s something to be said for performing music from people who look like you, and being able to represent your culture. What we’re exposed to matters.”</p> 
      <p>It’s not just higher education, either, Allen points out; it’s a societal issue as the country tries to play catch-up and heal the brokenness garnered through past mistakes. And every little step forward matters–especially in education.</p> 
      <p>“What we learn in school shapes our perspective and we can’t make progress if we’re leaving out pieces,” she says. “I was greatly impacted in a positive way by the education I received with my music degree at PUC. I was completely cultivated in unexpected ways, and it’s forever shaped me as a person and as a musician.</p> 
      <p>“Music is a universal language and it has a special and unique way of helping you understand another culture outside of your own,” Allen concludes. “Understanding is valuable. If we dare to not be angry, and to be gracious and willing to continue the conversation, we’ll move forward.”</p>

     <div class="entry-content"> 
      <p><strong>By Becky St. Clair</strong></p> 
      <p><em>Natalie Fode is a senior piano and nursing double major who grew up right here in St. Helena. With an Associate’s Degree in music (flute performance) and one in nursing already under her belt, she plans to graduate in June 2021 with her Bachelor’s Degrees in both. Natalie plays flute in the PUC Symphonic Wind Ensemble, and when we’re on-campus in person, she works in the department office managing recordings. She currently lives in Yountville with her husband, Jordan.</em></p> 
      <p><strong>Why music?</strong><br>I’ve always been fascinated with music for as long as I can remember. I have a musical family; my grandfather taught choir at various academies, and my grandmothers were/are both very good pianists. My dad is a great musician too, and plays the bass guitar, and my mom also plays the flute. I think this combination made me interested in music from a young age because music was often in the home in some form or another. I ultimately decided to pursue a music degree because I couldn’t imagine my life without it and I wanted to be better able to share my love of it with others, as well as to grow my composition, piano, and flute performance skills. I hope to someday teach lessons and continue writing music throughout my life.</p> 
      <p><strong>So it surrounded you for most of your life, but do you recall when you first started really noticing it and exploring it for yourself?</strong><br>My grandma first taught me the basics of piano when I was about four years old, which first awakened my love and fascination for piano. I don’t know where I got the idea of composing, but I remember playing the lap harp when I was about five or six and creating my own music on it. I also remember going around and making up songs (if you could call them that) about everything that happened in my life when I was little. It turns out each of these early interests developed into something that I now know and love and are all a part of me to this day.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>I ended up becoming extremely interested in composition and songwriting as I got older, writing songs from the time I was about 11 and starting my first choral piece at age 14. I have continued to pursue flute, piano, and composition during my time at PUC. Each of these early musical experiences are still a part of my life today as a college student and they will forever be a part of my musical identity.</p> 
      <p><strong>How has your experience been pursuing both music <em>and</em> nursing simultaneously?</strong><br>I would say the biggest challenge for me has been finding the time to stay in a creative headspace while also pursuing nursing, which is a different-type-of-difficult degree. I adore composition and wish that I had the time and creative energy to do it more often. Though it hasn’t always been an easy balancing act, I would say that music has been an oasis for me during the difficult times of the nursing program, which, as much as I love nursing, certainly existed.</p> 
      <p><strong>Nursing majors have crazy schedules; how did you manage that while also being in a music ensemble?</strong><br>First of all, I would like to mention that I took the first year and a half of my time at PUC to focus primarily on music and attempting to get into the nursing program. That allowed me to finish a lot of my classes for the AS in music degree, but not all. Once the nursing program began for me, the music department professors worked with my crazy clinical schedules and helped me achieve my goals in both nursing and music; I couldn’t have gotten this far if it wasn’t for their graciousness.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Nursing is, by necessity, a very structured program and so it speaks volumes that the music department has been willing to work around and with that to help me create the perfect fit during my time at PUC. Now, during my two bachelor degrees in nursing and music, the music professors are working with me more than ever due to “core weeks” (weeks one and six each quarter) which are a part of the BS in nursing when I have classes the majority of the day and can’t typically attend normal class periods. They’ve also worked with me through more crazy clinical schedules and have always been so understanding through it all.</p> 
      <p>I couldn’t be more blessed and grateful with the music department. It’s taken me five years to finish these two degrees, but the incredible experiences, connections, and future opportunities that I’ve gained along the way has made it all worthwhile.</p> 
      <p><strong>You and Jordan have recorded a few videos performing together; do you have plans to do something more formal with your combined skills?&nbsp;</strong><br>Jordan and I both love music. He’s been playing guitar since he was 12 and saxophone since he was nine, and we’ve both been casually singing in choirs and on our own from a young age. We have just recently started exploring who we are as a musical twosome and it’s been a really fun journey. We hope to make it a “thing” in the near future.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>We have a YouTube channel and want to fill it with covers and original songs, and hope to utilize other social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok to share as well. We also want to do concerts both locally and across the U.S. as a ministry, once things are a little less “germy” of course. Ha! This is important to us because we both want to share God’s love and the message of righteousness by faith with as many people as possible. We’d love to combine that message with speaking and music in the form of concerts and social media.</p> 
      <p><strong>What do you enjoy about being part of the music department?</strong><br>One of my favorite things about the music department is sitting in the office, working and listening to all of the students and ensembles practicing. It’s so inspiring, makes me smile, and it’s fun to hear people progress in their pieces. I also love the family feel of the department. It’s not huge, and so everyone gets to know everyone and there’s a real sense of closeness there that is quite unique. It feels like a home away from home.</p> 
      <p><strong>How do music and nursing intersect—at least for you?</strong><br>Music is inherently therapeutic, and so I definitely feel that my knowledge of music can help me provide my future patients with better care in the hospital. I’ve heard stories of nurses singing or performing for patients per their request and I can see that being something I’d be open to since I’m interested in treating the whole person in their healing process. I see it as a connecting point, regardless of where I am located or what I’m doing; music is something that I’ll carry with me everywhere.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Likewise, I think that the nursing mentality and my nursing skills are things that can benefit me in many different situations. Nursing has helped me to attack my instrument practicing more systematically which has been helpful for me. I also know that it will come in handy if anyone hurts themselves or has something go physically wrong during a rehearsal or lesson. Both music and nursing are focused on connecting with the whole person you are serving at that moment, and because of this they are interchangeable disciplines in many respects when they are done well.</p> 
      <p><strong>What is your ultimate career goal?</strong><br>Well…that’s rather ambiguous at the moment, if I’m honest. I am currently hoping to find a nursing job so that I can begin serving my community in whatever capacity is most needed. Eventually, I would love to work on a labor and delivery unit as I’ve always had a passion for obstetrics. This passion was likely spawned by being an aunt to eight kiddos and watching three of those births at various points throughout my childhood, as well as having a sister who worked as a labor and delivery and postpartum nurse for most of her career. It is possible that I would want to pursue a certified nurse midwife/nurse practitioner degree in the future, but that would be many years down the road, if ever; there are no concrete plans in place for that at this point.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>As far as music goes, from home jam-sessions with my husband and family, to writing my own compositions and songs, to teaching lessons or even potentially leading ensembles at the elementary or high-school level, I see myself using my music degree all the time. I would say that the knowledge I gained during my time in my AS and BS in music degrees is even more valuable to me than the degrees themselves in many respects. I’ve learned so much that I will carry with me throughout my life, and though the degree titles are inherently valuable, the information I gleaned while earning them is invaluable.</p> 
      <p><strong>If you could offer one piece of advice to incoming first-years at PUC, what would it be?</strong><br>Embrace the changes that inherently come along with your first year in college and to go for the thing that seems audaciously out-there if it’s something that you truly want to pursue. It’s not too late to switch your declared major, not too late to change your mind in pursuit of the desires of your heart. By all means, be smart about it, but whether it means adding, switching, or dropping a degree, if that’s what you think is best for you – do it! And go all-in.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Also, don’t wait any longer than you have to, because the sooner you make the switch, the more time your professors and advisors will have to work with you. Have those conversations early on, and bounce ideas off people you trust. I switched at the end of my first year, but there’s no “right way” to do it. It’s never too late to make a change. Don’t let your life decide itself for you–you get to hold the reins. Ask questions. Don’t let things just “happen to you” academically. Take an active role in your course planning, picking a major, and the timing, difficulty, and pace of your quarters.</p> 
      <p>And then, I would say something that seems almost contrary to my previous advice, but it isn’t: Prioritize your health, both mental and physical. Don’t push yourself too hard, it’s not worth it. Don’t hesitate to reach out when something feels off, and take advantage of the resources that PUC has to offer because no amount of hustle is worth your well-being. I pushed myself so hard and I got through it, but looking back I would advise my younger self to prioritize my health more. You’re a human, not a machine, and it’s important to realize that–and the earlier on, the better.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Most of all, I want to say: You’ve got this! It’s a long road ahead, but if you find a major and future career that you love, and prioritize your well-being so that you can enjoy the journey and the destination, it will all be worth it.</p>

     <div class="entry-content"> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Your first quarter of college was probably VERY different than you imagined, and for the record, we HATED not having everyone on campus and are thrilled to welcome everyone. Your first month on PUC’s physical campus will likely be a bit of a whirlwind. You’ll be meeting new people, learning new things, and having a new schedule. Here are some tips to help you get on the right track.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Attend Class</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You’re in college to go to classes and learn. Please do yourself a solid and attend class. If you’re not a morning person, don’t schedule early morning classes. If you rather have your evenings free, take classes in the afternoon. Make a schedule that you can work with that won’t make you skip class.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Stay Organized&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">By staying organized in college, you will have a better time conquering your assignments, tests, and other things. The first month of school may be overwhelming for you, so get a planner, use your calendar, just find a way that works for you to stay organized.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Don’t Forget To Eat&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Please don’t forget to eat! Your health is important and if you don’t eat well, you might have a hard time concentrating. Fight the temptation to snack on junk food and instead indulge in healthier options. It’s a good idea to have water with you at all times. You must stay hydrated!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Meet With Your Academic Advisor&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You’re going to have a lot of questions regarding your classes and major. Having meetings with your academic advisor will be very helpful to you. They are there to guide you in the right direction and help you out in any way they can.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Put Yourself Out There&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the best things about college is that you get the chance to meet people from all over the world. It’s not always easy putting yourself out there, but during the first month, most students will feel the same way as you. Join clubs, study groups, intramurals, etc. Even if you’re scared, put yourself out there.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Find Your Quiet Place&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">From going to class, eating at the cafeteria, and living in the dorms, you’ll be surrounded by people most of the time. If you need your space and some quiet time, find a spot on campus that lets you have time to yourself.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Get A Good Night’s Sleep&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lack of sleep is what causes the most stress, so please make sure you’re getting good sleep every night. There will be nights where you and your friends stay up late studying and getting to know each other, but if you don’t get enough hours of sleep you won’t feel so great the next morning.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Be True To Yourself&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">College is a chance to have a fresh start, but don’t lose sight of your values and beliefs. You’ll be figuring out new things about yourself, but don’t feel that you have to act a certain way or be someone different just to fit in. Be true to yourself and let your light shine to others.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Take in every moment during your first month on campus. Be open to change, new opportunities, and keep an open mind. Enjoy the beautiful Napa Valley and remember that your PUC family is here for you!&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Move-in day is exciting! You arrive at your new home-away-from-home, you get to meet your new room and lots of new people, and you get to move into your new room! As exciting as it is, it can also be a little overwhelming so here are some tips to help you prepare for move-in day. We can’t wait to see you!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Arrive On Time&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Keep note of what time check-in starts. It’s smart to move-in as soon as you can because it is a process. From checking-in with the front desk to fill out papers, to finally moving into your room, it can take longer than you think. Also the earlier you move-in, the more of a chance you will get a good parking spot.</span></p> 
      <p><b>Label Your Boxes and Containers&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you are using boxes or containers to pack your things, label them. It’ll be helpful to remind yourself which of your items are in each box or container. It also makes unpacked MUCH faster.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p><b>Wash Sheets &amp; Towels Beforehand&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s good to wash your bedsheets and towels before moving-in so it’s fresh and clean in your dorm room. Also, who wants to spend their first few days of college doing laundry?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Clean Your Room Before Moving-In</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Before you move your things in, make sure you do a quick clean. Disinfect your shelves, dressers, and desks. Vacuum or sweep the floor and clean your windows. Having large trash bags will also be helpful to you. After a hot summer, your room might be dusty so it’s smart to do a quick clean of your room before you bring your stuff in and unpack.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Use A Dolly&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The dorm does provide dollies, but they are limited. If you don’t have a dolly and need one, ask your front desk. If you own a dolly, bring it with you. Having a dolly will make things easier for you to bring your things from your car to your room, especially big appliances like a fridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Bring Tools &amp; Supplies&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tools and supplies such as scissors and command strips will come in handy when you move into your dorm room. Scissors are a tool you’ll need whether you’re opening up boxes or plastic packages. Command strips will help you decorate your room, like hanging up string lights or picture frames. You can’t put nails in your walls, so command strips are an easy way to hang things on your walls.&nbsp;</span></p>

       </noscript></p> 
      <p><b>Have Water &amp; Snacks&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Moving in takes a lot of time and work. It’s important to have cold water and snacks to keep you hydrated and energized during the process. You don’t want to get hangry while moving-in! (Once you’re all moved-in, reward yourself to a delicious meal!)&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Have Bathroom Essentials&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Don’t pack your toiletries at the bottom of the bag or box. Make sure you have easy access to the things you might need right away. Don’t forget to put toilet paper and soap in the bathroom right away!</span></p> 
      <p><b>Keep Receipts &amp; Packaging</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Once you move-in, you might realize you won’t actually use some of the things&nbsp;you bought. Keep your receipts and try not to damage the packaging boxes so you can return those items. We can all use some extra cash.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Make a Shopping List&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You may realize there are things you forgot. You’re not alone, it happens to the best of us. Start a list with your roommate. A trip to Napa Target might be in your future.</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Hopefully, these tips will help make your move-in day go a little smoother. Once you get to your designated residence hall, do not hesitate to ask the dean, RA, or dorm staff any questions or concerns you have. We can’t wait to see you around campus!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p>Note: Be sure you carefully read your communications from Student Life to understand what COVID-19 safety precautions will be in place for move-in day this year and how that might alter your plans!</p>

     <div class="entry-content"> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the best things about moving into your dorm is that you get the chance to decorate it! Since this will be your home-away-from-home, it’s important to make it your&nbsp;own. It’s never too early to start planning, here are a&nbsp;few suggestions to help you get started.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Cozy Bedding&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Your bedding is what will really make your room feel like home. Invest in a bedding set that fits your style and comfort needs. Remember, you can never have too many pillows!</span></p> 
      <p><b>Table Lamp</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Table lamps are great additions to every dorm room. Not only will they&nbsp;add extra lighting, but softer lighting as well. Target and Amazon have great selections allowing you to find the right one to fit your style.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Rugs&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">From a neutral rug to a patterned rug, buying one will add character to your room. If you’re not sure what your roommate’s style will be, play it safe and buy a more neutral one.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Comfy Chair&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Whether you need a great desk chair, or you prefer something cozy and cute in the corner, it can’t hurt to have additional seating.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>String Lights&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Many college students buy string lights to decorate their room adding some much-needed ambiance. They obviously come in tons of shapes and colors and can literally go anywhere. It’s a no-brainer.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Photos&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You can never go wrong with using photos to decorate your room. Stick them on your wall in a cool grid, frame some, there’s really no limit. Having photos of your friends and family is a great way to make the place feel like home.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Wall Art&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Add more charm into your room by decorating it with wall art, like posters and picture prints. Just make sure that you use tape or damage free hooks to place them on your wall.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">It can be tough figuring out what style you want your room to be, but the process is fun. Hopefully, these decorating ideas give you some inspiration for what you want in your dorm room.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b><i>Note: Be sure you carefully read your communications from Student Life and regularly check the&nbsp;</i></b><b><i><a class="c-link" href="https://www.puc.edu/academics/preparing-for-fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-10207">Fall Campus Plan</a></i></b><b><i>&nbsp;webpage&nbsp;to stay up-to-date with the COVID-19 safety precautions PUC will be enforcing.</i></b></p>

      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You may think you will only use your dorm room to sleep but sometimes your college dorm room becomes … everything: your bedroom, kitchen, study area, sometimes even your gym. So you’ll want to come prepared. Here are a few dorm room ‘must-haves’ to add to your packing list!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Blankets</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blankets are the best and if you ask me, you can never have enough. Not only will they keep you warm but they’ll help make your room cozier and give it a more homey feeling, plus, they look nice! Feeling a little anxious? Give a weighted blanket a try.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Check out </span><a href="https://www.target.com/c/throw-blankets-home-decor/-/N-4y61q"><span style="font-weight:400;">Target</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HOZY-Blanket-Microplush-Lightweight-Blankets/dp/B07PF8HJ7S/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=blankets&amp;qid=1579739462&amp;refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&amp;rnid=2470954011&amp;rps=1&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1"><span style="font-weight:400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for comfy and affordable blankets.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>A Fridge &amp; Microwave&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Investing in a fridge and microwave will save your life. It’s better to have your own fridge in your room instead of always having to go to the dorm kitchen to store your food. You won’t have to worry about someone stealing your food or drinks because it will be right in your room. You will also have a place to store water and microwavable meals. Owning your own microwave comes in handy when you have those late-night craves of noodles.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Check out Target to find good quality </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/whirlpool-4-3-cu-ft-mini-refrigerator-stainless-steel-bc-127b/-/A-17304428"><span style="font-weight:400;">fridges</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/black-decker-0-7-cu-ft-700w-microwave-oven-black-em720cpn-p/-/A-50568401"><span style="font-weight:400;">microwaves</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>A Coffee &amp; Tea Maker&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you are a huge coffee or tea drinker, you should definitely invest in buying a coffee or tea maker. It will save you time and money.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Check out Target for coffee or tea makers.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>An Electric Water Kettle&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">An electric water kettle is a convenient addition to college life. It quickly heats your water so you can sip on your hot cocoa or enjoy a cup of noodles.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Check out </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/aroma-1l-electric-water-kettle-stainless-steel/-/A-53621072"><span style="font-weight:400;">Target</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ovente-KP72W-BPA-Free-Protection-Indicator/dp/B00DEQDEZA/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=hot+water+kettle&amp;qid=1579802658&amp;refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&amp;rnid=2470954011&amp;rps=1&amp;sr=8-8"><span style="font-weight:400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for affordable electric water kettles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Dinnerware &amp; Flatware&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Having your own dinnerware and flatware in your room is useful for when you cook for yourself or with your friends. Instead of buying plastic plates, bowls and utensils, buy reusable ones so you never run out. Don’t forget dish soap!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Target has affordable </span><a href="https://www.target.com/c/college-dinnerware-kitchen-dining-back-to/-/N-4yib3?lnk=Dinnerware"><span style="font-weight:400;">dinnerware</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.target.com/c/college-kitchen-dining-back-to/-/N-5v9xaZ5xr1y?type=products&amp;lnk=Flatware"><span style="font-weight:400;">flatware</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for your dorm room.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Cleaning Supplies&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cleaning supplies are always a must. It’s good to keep your room nice and tidy, and having cleaning supplies will help you out with that. Buy disinfecting </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/clorox-disinfecting-wipes-bleach-free-cleaning-wipes-fresh-9ct/-/A-12992360"><span style="font-weight:400;">wipes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> or</span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/lysol-lemon-breeze-scented-all-purpose-cleaner-38-disinfectant-spray-32oz/-/A-14062784"><span style="font-weight:400;"> sprays</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> to keep your desk, sink, and drawers clean. A </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/scotch-brite-non-scratch-dishwand/-/A-47981892"><span style="font-weight:400;">dishwashing wand</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> is also very useful when you have to wash your dishes.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you can’t stand your floor being dirty, you should invest in a vacuum. Amazon has a great </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eureka-NES210-Swivel-Lightweight-Cleaner/dp/B075P7J8BB/ref=nav_ya_signin?crid=2GK741B49LD18&amp;keywords=vacuum%2Bcleaner&amp;qid=1579805998&amp;sprefix=vac%2Caps%2C200&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1"><span style="font-weight:400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that’s easy to store and it’s affordable!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Storage Containers&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Dorm rooms are small so it’s super useful to buy storage containers. Baskets, bins, and utility carts are a great way to keep all your things organized while saving space. You’ll have a place to put your food, personal items, cleaning supplies, and even clothes. </span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Check out </span><a href="https://www.target.com/c/dorm-storage-organization/-/N-5tf7e?lnk=StorageOrganiza"><span style="font-weight:400;">Target</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, TJ Maxx, and Marshalls to find storage containers that will fit all your things and go with your room aesthetic or just order from Amazon.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>A Laundry Hamper</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Getting a laundry hamper shouldn’t even be a question. This is a need (no matter how much you don’t like doing laundry). Where else do you expect to put your dirty clothes? Don’t forget detergent and fabric softener!</span></p> 
      <p><a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=laundry+hamper&amp;category=0%7CAll%7Cmatchallpartial%7Call+categories&amp;tref=typeahead%7Cterm%7C4%7Claundry+hamper%7C%7C%7Cservice&amp;searchRawTerm=laundry+h"><span style="font-weight:400;">Target</span></a> <span style="font-weight:400;">obviously has these too.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><b>Power Strip/extension cord</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sometimes the outlets in your room are either too far or in an odd spot for you. Buying an </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/power-value-pack-6-outlet-power-strip-3-outlet-extension-cord-3-outlet-wall-adapter-general-electric/-/A-15022148"><span style="font-weight:400;">extension cord</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> will help keep all your things charged near you and in places that work for you.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Reusable Bags</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You will thank yourself for getting reusable bags. Especially in California, places charge you for buying a bag so having a reusable bag will save you money and help you carry all your things. Besides shopping, they are useful for moving your things into the dorm. If you forgot to bring some with you the College Market has some for sale!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>A First-Aid Kit&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s smart to have a first aid kit packed and ready in your room. Having bandages and alcohol wipes will come in handy in the times you need them. It’s also good to have medicine in your room in case you get sick or have a headache.</span></p> 
      <p><b>Mattress Pad</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you’re a sensitive sleeper or just want extra comfort, get a mattress pad. It’ll help make your bed firmer and less lumpy.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=mattress+pad&amp;category=0%7CAll%7Cmatchallpartial%7Call+categories&amp;tref=typeahead%7Cterm%7C0%7Cmattress+pad%7C%7C%7Cservice&amp;searchRawTerm=mattress+"><span style="font-weight:400;">Target</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> has lots to choose from.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Shower Essentials&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Besides your hair products and body wash, always have an extra towel in case your other one is in the laundry. Also, don’t forget your shower shoes!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>A Fan&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Whether you like a breeze or some ambient noise, a fan is always a good addition to your room.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Trash Can&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You’re going to need a trash can in your room. Try to find one that doesn’t take up a lot of space and don’t forget trash bags.</span></p> 
      <p><b>A Piece Of Home</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Whether you bring a bunch of photographs, your favorite mug, or a special pillow, it’s always nice to bring a piece of home with you to school to provide a little extra comfort for the days you feel homesick.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s no secret buying things for your dorm room can get expensive, so always check for deals online or in-store and lookout for student discounts. Don’t let yourself get overwhelmed with all the things that come with moving into the dorms, remember to have some fun!</span></p>

      <p><strong>By Becky St. Clair</strong></p> 
      <p>Have you ever watched a movie without a soundtrack? Imagine a silent scene of a forest in the early morning with fog drifting around the trees and an occasional bird or fox or squirrel darting out and then back in. This could be a creepy horror movie, a documentary about ecosystems, a war drama, a Hallmark Christmas film, or something else entirely. Without the soundtrack, it’s hard to know how to feel or what to expect. Music is a powerful and effective way to set the mood of a scene, and no story would be the same without it.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Christmas has a soundtrack, too, and though it’s different for every person, we all find joy and comfort in the familiar music of the holiday. Yes, some of it is “Santa Baby” or “Linus &amp; Lucy” style, but even some people who aren’t particularly religious will admit that “O, Holy Night” brings tears to their eyes.</p> 
      <p>In this month’s blog, we’re exploring the story of the Nativity through carols. At the end of the post there is a link to a playlist of all the pieces we review here today, so you can carol your way through the story of Christmas. (Pssst: Feel free to sing along. We won’t judge!)</p> 
      <p><strong>“Gabriel’s Message” a Basque folk Christmas carol</strong></p> 
      <p>Originally based on a 13th/14th-century carol called “Angelus ad Virginem,” this carol tells the story of the angel Gabriel visiting Mary to deliver the news that will change her life forever. Though not a well-known or popular carol, it has been recorded by popular artists such as Charlotte Church and Sting. A cheerful and catchy repeating line throughout the song is “Most highly favored lady; gloria!”</p> 
      <p><strong>“Magnificat” by Johann Sebastian Bach</strong></p> 
      <p>This lively piece is the only carol that comes straight from the Bible. The text, found in Luke 1:46-55, is titled in scripture as “Mary’s Song.” She has just found out–at 14 years old, mind you–that she’s pregnant, carrying the most important baby the world will ever know, and she has made her way to visit her cousin, who is also expecting an important child. Upon her arrival she bursts into song, proclaiming her adoration of God and her appreciation for what he has done. There are some unexpected political/historical points of significance in Mary’s song, as well. (Read <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2018/12/20/marys-magnificat-bible-is-revolutionary-so-evangelicals-silence-it/">this article</a> for one perspective.) This piece was actually Bach’s first major liturgical composition on a Latin text.</p> 
      <p><strong>“O Little Town of Bethlehem” by Phillips Brooks &amp; Lewis H. Redner</strong></p> 
      <p>This carol is, of course, is a poetic commentary on the important place this little town became, all because a specific baby was born there. Brooks spent Christmas 1866 in Bethlehem and was inspired to pen the lyrics known ‘round the Christian world today. The tune was composed by his church organist back home in Boston, though the tune we know in the Adventist Church is not the one they use in England and in many liturgical churches–they use instead an arrangement of an old folk tune put together by Ralph Vaughan Williams called “Forest Green.”</p> 
      <p><strong>“Jesus, Jesus Rest Your Head”</strong> <strong>an Appalachian folk carol</strong></p> 
      <p>This is a piece collected by Kentucky native John Jacob Niles, who began collecting folk songs and composing his own as a teenager in the early 20th century. The tune is beautiful, and it paints the scene of Jesus lying in his manger bed, while also pointing out that many terrible people sleep in “feather beds” so one’s station in life doesn’t matter so much as one’s character.&nbsp;</p> 
      <p><strong>“Away in a Manger”</strong> <strong>by an unknown composer</strong></p> 
      <p>Though the text has been mis-attributed to Martin Luther, the fact remains that its origins are still relatively unknown; though it has been determined that the carol is most likely American. It depicts the Christ child in the stable on the night he was born, surrounded by what one might typically expect in a stable. Though in America we typically use a tune written by organist and songwriter James R. Murray, in the U.K. the more commonly used tune is “Cradle Song,” composed (interestingly) by a carpenter in Philadelphia by the name of William J. Kirkpatrick.</p> 
      <p><strong>“While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks by Night” by multiple composers/writers</strong></p> 
      <p>In the late 17th century, Nahum Tate, a British poet known for his metrical psalms, turned his attention to the story of Christ’s birth in the book of Luke. He wrote a metrical version of the story of the shepherds so it could be sung directly from scripture, and he called it “Song of the Angels at the Nativity of our Blessed Saviour.” Interestingly, a specific tune was not created for it; rather, publications of the text indicated it could be sung to any number of tunes “of common measure.”&nbsp;</p> 
      <p><strong>“Hark! The Herald Angels Sing!” by Felix Mendelssohn, William Cummings, &amp; Charles Wesley</strong></p> 
      <p>Surprise! This wasn’t actually originally a Christmas song at all. Well, okay, that’s kind of a stretch. The <em>tune</em> was originally from one of Mendelssohn’s cantatas and had nothing to do with anything sacred at all–it was actually in honor of the 400th anniversary of the invention of the printing press, and paid homage to Johannes Gutenberg. However, in the mid-19th century, a former choir boy took the tune and put it together with a sacred poem from a collection of Christmas hymns and poems by Charles Wesley, creating the carol we know today. It is now regularly performed in celebration of the visit the angels paid to the shepherds to announce the birth of the Savior.</p> 
      <p><strong>“The Coventry Carol”</strong> <strong>a traditional English carol</strong></p> 
      <p>Dating from the Coventry mystery plays of the 16th century, this carol is one of the most hauntingly beautiful tunes ever written. One interesting thing to note is that it’s in a minor key–a rarity in the collection of familiar carols–but there’s a reason for that. While we all likely recognize the tune, it’s doubtful many have stopped to ponder the meaning of the words. This is likely the only carol honoring the part of the story where Herod loses his mind over being usurped by a baby of lowly birth and orders The Massacre of the Innocents. It is, however, an important part of the story of Jesus’ birth, because his life was spared and God’s plan of salvation marched on.</p> 
      <p><strong>“The Adoration of the Magi” by Ottorino Respighi</strong></p> 
      <p>We decided to try something different at this part of the story (other than “We Three Kings”), and opted to introduce our readers to something new. This piece is one of three known as “Trittico Botticelliano,” composed to musically illustrate a triptych of paintings by Sandro Botticelli. There are so many beautiful elements in this piece–the ethereal double-reed instrumentation woven throughout, the incorporation of “O Come, O Come Emmanuel,” the rich support of the strings, the calculated use of percussion–you can clearly imagine the kings making their way to worship the Christ child as you listen.</p> 
      <p><strong>“Joy the World” by Isaac Watts &amp; Lowell Mason</strong></p> 
      <p>We end our caroling journey with one based not on the Nativity, but on the <em>second</em> Advent, and taken not from the New Testament, but from Psalms. Published by Watts in 1719, the poem was originally titled, “The Messiah’s Coming and Kingdom,” celebrating the kingly rule of Christ over all of heaven and earth. In 1836, Mason published the poem with a tune he attributed to Handel, but over the last 180-or-so years, no one has been able to figure out exactly which Handel tune he was referring to, though it’s suspected that some bars and lines of melody were inspired by parts of Handel’s “Messiah.” It is a fitting end to our musical Nativity to sing joyfully that the Lord has come. Let Heaven and nature sing!</p>

     <div class="entry-content"> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">We hope you’re super excited to finally have the REAL college experience. That means moving into your new dorm room! It’s important to save as much space as you can, especially if you are living with a roommate. Space will always be limited. What’s great is places like Target and Amazon sell awesome items to help you save space and stay organized. Here are four simple items to help keep&nbsp;your dorm room looking and functioning great.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Storage Ottomans&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You can never have enough seating in your room for lounging, chatting with friends, or study groups. While storage ottomans give you an extra seat, they also help maximize your space. They are a great&nbsp;spot to store movies or extra supplies that might not fit in your cupboards.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Under Bed Storage Bins&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">You truly cannot have enough of these. With a variety of sizes, storage bins or boxes fit great under your bed and save space in your room. From plastic bins to fabric boxes, you’ll have many options on how to store your shoes, clothes, or items rarely used. If you want to make things easier for yourself, buy clear plastic bins to see which of your items are in each box.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Foldable Storage Cubes&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Foldable storage cubes can help organize your snacks, toiletries, and school supplies. They’re easy to store and fit perfectly on shelves, inside your closet, or under your bed.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b>Command Hooks&nbsp;</b></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Command hooks are useful for many reasons. They won’t just help hang frames or string lights around your room, but they can also be used as a place to hang your keys, bags, or towels. The best part is that they won’t damage your walls!&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><span style="font-weight:400;">These are just a few of the MANY&nbsp;ways to organize your room so look around, &nbsp;plan ahead,&nbsp;and get some great items before you arrive on campus.&nbsp;</span></p> 
      <p><b><i>Note: Be sure you carefully read your communications from Student Life and regularly check the&nbsp;</i></b><b><i><a class="c-link" href="https://www.puc.edu/academics/preparing-for-fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-10207">Fall Campus Plan</a></i></b><b><i>&nbsp;webpage&nbsp;to stay up-to-date with the COVID-19 safety precautions PUC will be enforcing.</i></b></p>
