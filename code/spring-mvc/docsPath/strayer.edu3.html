      <h1 id="h6660"> Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy </h1>
      <p>POLICY</p> 
      <p>Strayer University (SU) is committed to maintaining education programs and activities that are free of sexbased<br> discrimination, as defined in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX). SU prohibits<br> sexual harassment of any members of the university community and any retaliatory behavior related to<br> reports of such conduct. This policy was adopted to ensure the safety of students and personnel, a<br> healthy and thriving workplace and learning environment, and compliance with Title IX in SU’s education<br> programs and activities.</p> 
      <p>RATIONALE</p> 
      <p>Since the University is committed to providing an environment free of sexual harassment, this policy<br> establishes the definitions, procedures, prohibited conduct, and sanctions necessary for maintaining the<br> desired environment.</p> 
      <p>DEFINITIONS</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community</span><br> Community includes all Strayer University students, faculty, administrators, staff, contracted workers, and<br> others who participate in any University-related activities, including but not limited to fieldwork, practicum,<br> and internship.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Complainant</span><br> Complainant means an individual who is participating in or attempting to participate in a Strayer University<br> Education Program or Activity and is alleged to be the victim of conduct that could constitute a violation of<br> this policy if proved.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Education Program or Activity</span><br> Education Program or Activity includes locations, events, or circumstances over which Strayer University<br> exercises substantial control over both the Respondent and the context in which the Sexual Harassment<br> occurs.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Formal Complain</span>t<br> Formal Complaint means a document filed by a Complainant or signed by the Title IX Coordinator<br> alleging Sexual Harassment against a Respondent and requesting that the institution investigate the<br> allegation of Sexual Harassment.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hostile Environment</span><br> A Hostile Environment is an objectively hostile or abusive Strayer University setting caused by sexual<br> harassment that is so severe, persistent, and pervasive that it effectively denies a person equal access to<br> an Education Program or Activity.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prohibited Conduct</span><br> Prohibited Conduct includes Sexual Harassment and Retaliation, as defined in this policy, provided that<br> the conduct either</p> 
      <p> a) occurs in the context of a Strayer University Education Program or Activity; or </p> 
      <p>b) creates a hostile environment in a Strayer University Education Program or Activity.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Respondent</span><br> The Respondent is the person alleged to have engaged in Prohibited Conduct.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Retaliation</span><br> Retaliation is an adverse action taken in retribution for one’s reporting, supporting, or participating in an<br> investigation related to an allegation of Prohibited Conduct.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sanction</span><br> A Sanction is a disciplinary action that may result from Prohibited Conduct. Disciplinary action may<br> include one or more of the following: </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>a) formal written warning; </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>b) mandated remedial activity; </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>c)&nbsp;suspension from Strayer University; </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>d) dismissal from a program; </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>e) dismissal from Strayer University; or&nbsp;</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>f) cancellation of a previously-awarded academic credit or degree. </p> 
      <p>This list of possible sanctions is neither&nbsp;progressive nor exhaustive, and Strayer University reserves the right to assess sanctions on a case-by case<br> basis.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sexual Harassment</span><br> Sexual Harassment means conduct that occurs within an Education Program or Activity, on the basis of<br> sex, and satisfies one or more of the following:</p> 
      <ol> 
       <li>A Strayer University employee, or contracted worker, conditioning the provision of a Strayer University<br> aid, benefit, or service on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;</li> 
       <li>Unwelcome conduct that results in what a reasonable person would deem to be a Hostile Environment;&nbsp;or</li> 
       <li>“Sexual assault” as defined in the Clery Act at 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(6)(A)(v); and “dating violence” as<br> defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(10), “domestic violence” as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(8), or “stalking”<br> as defined in 34 U.S.C. 12291(a)(30). (34 C.F.R. 106.30(a) (2020); commonly known as the Violence<br> Against Women Act or “VAWA”).</li> 
      </ol> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary Suspension</span><br> Summary Suspension is the immediate suspension of a Student. Summary Suspension is a temporary<br> status during which a student is prohibited from engaging in identified Strayer University activities while<br> an evaluation of alleged Prohibited Conduct is being completed. When Summary Suspension is imposed<br> on a Respondent, that individual will be provided with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision<br> immediately following the imposition of Summary Suspension under the procedures outlined in Section V<br> below.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supportive Measures</span><br> Supportive Measures means non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate<br> and reasonably available, without fee or charge. Supportive Measures may include counseling,<br> extensions of deadlines, course-related adjustments, modifications of class schedules, campus escort<br> services, mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in work or housing locations, leaves<br> of absence, increased security and monitoring of certain areas, and other similar measures. Strayer<br> University will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to a Complainant or<br> Respondent, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality does not impair the ability of Strayer<br> University to provide the Supportive Measures.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suspension</span><br> Suspension is a Strayer University-initiated temporary status during which a student is denied access to<br> the courseroom and prohibited from engaging in Strayer University activities until stated conditions have<br> been met.</p> 
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">University Administrator</span><br> A University Administrator is a Strayer University employee who holds a position of responsibility at a<br> supervisory or managerial level, or higher. For purposes of faculty, “University Administrator” refers to a<br> faculty member holding the position of faculty chair or higher.</p> 
      <p>PROCEDURES</p> 
      <p>I. Reporting of Suspected Prohibited Conduct<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A. Anyone may report an instance of alleged prohibited conduct to:</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. The faculty member or official directly associated with the activity or event;</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. A university administrator</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3. The Title IX Coordinator; or</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4. Student Affairs.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>B. Strayer University strongly encourages the prompt reporting of sexual misconduct to allow the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>University to respond promptly and effectively. If the reported respondent is not a member of<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the Strayer community or is no longer associated with the University at the time of the report<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>or at the time a resolution process is initiated, Strayer may be unable to conduct an<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>investigation or take disciplinary action.Upon receipt of an allegation, a faculty member,<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>official, or administrator will notify the Title IX Coordinator and/or Student Affairs.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>C. Student Affairs may be contacted at:<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. Email: studentaffairs@strayer.edu ;<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. U.S. Postal Service: 1133 15th St. NW, Washington, DC 20005; (please note that hardcopy<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>reports filed by mail may additional time for the University’s initial response and all<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>reporters are encouraged to also submit a report electronically or to notify the Title IX<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Coordinator via email or telephone that they have submitted a hard copy report)<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3. Phone: 1-877-261-6908; or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4. By submitting a report (including anonymous reports)</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>D. Upon receipt of an allegation, Student Affairs will document reports of prohibited conduct<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>under this policy and will maintain such documentation as dictated by the applicable document<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>retention policy.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>E. Upon receipt of an allegation, Student Affairs will promptly contact the Complainant to discuss<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the availability of supportive measures, consider the Complainant’s wishes with respect to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>supportive measures, inform the Complainant of the availability of supportive measures with<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>or without the filing of a formal complaint, and explain the Title IX complaint resolution<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>process, including which members of the University may have access to – and for what<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>purpose – information obtained during this process.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>F. An allegation of prohibited conduct under this policy must include:<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. The individual(s) against whom the alleged prohibited conduct is directed.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. A brief description of the alleged prohibited conduct, including the date(s), time(s), and<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>place(s) if known.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3. The corrective action the Student or member of the Strayer Community is seeking.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>G. In the event of a factual dispute at any stage of these procedures, and which follows the report<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>of alleged prohibited conduct, the burden is on the alleged victim to establish that their version<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>of the events in question is more likely true than not true, also known as preponderance of the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>evidence, which shall serve as the evidentiary standard in such cases.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>H. If at any state of these procedures the Complainant requests in writing (may be written or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>electronic writing) that the complaint not be pursued, that request will be honored unless the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Title IX Coordinator determines that signing a formal complaint to initiate an investigation over<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the wishes of the complainant is not clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I. If at any stage of these procedures the Complainant requests anonymity, good faith efforts will<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>be undertaken to act consistently with that request. However, the student is advised that the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>ability to maintain anonymity while pursuing a claim under this policy may be limited by law or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>regulation in certain circumstances.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>J. The Complainant maintains the right to notify law enforcement at any time or to refrain from<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>contacting such authorities. The Complainant also maintains the right to seek an order of<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>protection, no-contact order, restraining order, or similar lawful order from any court with<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>jurisdiction. Upon the Complainant’s request, Strayer will assist the alleged victim(s) in<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>notifying law enforcement. Strayer at all times retains the right to notify law enforcement, at its<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>discretion, to protect its students and/or employees or when required by law or regulation.</p> 
      <p>II. Initial Resolution Process<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A. The Initial Resolution Process shall be administered by Student Affairs. Student Affairs will<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>consult with Human Resources when a faculty member or employee is involved.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>B. Upon receipt of an allegation, Student Affairs will determine whether the allegation as shared<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>constitutes an allegation of prohibited conduct under this policy. A complaint will be dismissed<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>in the event that, at any time during the investigation or hearing any of the following occur: </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>a) the alleged conduct does not meet the definition of sexual harassment under this policy even<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>if proved; </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>b) the conduct did not occur in an Educational Program or Activity; or </p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>c) specific circumstances prevent the institution from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>C. Only after a Formal Complaint has been filed, Student Affairs may offer both parties the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>opportunity to attempt an informal resolution of the matter. In order for any kind of informal<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>resolution process to occur that forecloses the procedures contained in this policy, the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>following must occur:<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. Both parties must give voluntary, informed, written consent to attempt informal resolution.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. Both parties must be informed of any consequences of participating in an informal<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>resolution process.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3. Parties must be notified that they can withdraw from any informal resolution process at<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>any time and resume the formal grievance process.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4. Informal Resolution is not available where allegations involve employee sexual<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>harassment of a Student.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5. If informal resolution is not reached, the allegation will be sent back to the formal<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>grievance process as defined in this policy (or to Human Resources as appropriate) for<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>investigation and review.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>D. At any time during any portion of the procedures contained in this policy, either party may<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>request a temporary delay of the grievance process or the limited extension of time frames for<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>good cause with written notice to the complainant and the respondent of the delay or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>extension and the reasons for the action. Good cause may include considerations such as the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>absence of a party, a party’s advisor, or a witness; concurrent law enforcement activity; or the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>need for language assistance or accommodation of disabilities. Strayer University reserves<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the right, in its sole discretion, to deny such requests if they are made merely to delay or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>impede the prompt resolution of such matters.</p> 
      <p>III. Investigation and Review<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A. Allegations of prohibited conduct under this policy will be investigated by an independent<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>review panel if the Respondent is a Student. Allegations will receive a prompt, fair, and<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>impartial investigation and resolution. The process will be conducted by school officials who<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>receive annual training under this policy, which includes but is not limited to training on issues<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual harassment, and stalking, and how to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>conduct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of victims and promotes<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>accountability.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>B. Allegations of prohibited conduct under this policy will be investigated by Strayer University’s<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Human Resources department if the respondent is a Strayer University employee or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>contractor. Allegations will receive a prompt, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>C. Throughout the investigation and review process, there shall be a presumption that the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination regarding<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>D. Investigations of alleged prohibited conduct will include:<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. Notification to the respondent of the allegation of prohibited conduct and that respondent<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination regarding<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance process.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>2. An opportunity for both parties to submit any writing, information, evidence, and/or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>witnesses supporting or refuting the allegation. Both parties shall have the ability to review<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>any such information available at that time that was provided by another party prior to any<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>interviews, meetings, or hearings, so long as such information is directly related to the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>allegations. Note that prior to a live hearing, both parties must have at least ten (10) days<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>to make corrections, provide context, and prepare responses to such information or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>evidence.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>3. For all hearings, investigative interviews, or other meetings, the provision of written notice<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>to a party whose participation is invited or expected, which notice shall include the date,<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>time, location, participants, with sufficient time for the party to prepare to participate.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>4. Prior to completion of the investigative report, Strayer University will send to each party<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>and the party’s advisor, if any, the evidence subject to inspection and review in an<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>electronic format or a hard copy, and the parties will have at least 10 calendar days to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>submit a written response, which the investigator will consider prior to completion of the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>investigative report. The institution shall make all such evidence subject to the parties’<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>inspection and review available at any hearing to give each party equal opportunity to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>refer to such evidence during the hearing, including for purposes of cross-examination.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>5. Strayer University will create an investigative report that fairly summarizes relevant<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>evidence and, at least 10 calendar days prior to a hearing (if a hearing is required) or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>other time of determination regarding responsibility, send to each party and the party’s<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>advisor, if any, the investigative report in an electronic format or a hard copy, for their<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>review and written response.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6. Strayer University shall not access, consider, disclose, or otherwise use a party’s records<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional’s or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>paraprofessional’s capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made and<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the party, unless the institution<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>obtains that party’s voluntary, written consent to do so for a grievance process under this<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>section (if a party is not an “eligible student,” as defined in 34 C.F.R. 99.3, then the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>institution must obtain the voluntary, written consent of a “parent,” as defined in 34 C.F.R.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>99.3).</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>E. Role and Appointment of Advisors<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. During the course of any grievance proceeding, parties’ advisors may be, but are not<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>required to be, attorneys. Strayer University will not limit the choice or presence of an<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>advisor for either the complainant or respondent in any meeting or grievance proceeding;<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>however, the institution may establish restrictions regarding the extent to which the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>advisor may participate in the proceedings, as long as the restrictions apply equally to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>both parties. During the investigative phase, advisors will only be allowed to interact with<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Strayer University personnel and shall not have direct contact with adverse parties or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>witnesses. During a live hearing, advisors will conduct cross-examination.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>2. If a party does not have an advisor present at the live hearing, Strayer University will<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>provide, without fee or charge to that party, an advisor of the institution’s choice solely for<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the purpose of conducting cross-examination on behalf of that party. The institutionallyprovided<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>advisor may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. Only advisors may crossexamine<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>another party or adverse witness. To be clear, under no circumstances will one<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>party be allowed to directly cross-examine another party or an adverse witness.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>3. A party must notify Strayer University at least seven (7) days prior to any hearing or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>proceeding at which an advisor may participate with the contact information for that<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>advisor. If a party does not have their own advisor but will need to have one provided by<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Strayer University, that party must also notify Strayer University at least seven (7) days<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>prior to any hearing or proceeding at which an advisor may participate so that the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>University can arrange for advisor to be present and to have time to prepare for such<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>hearing or proceeding.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>F. Live Hearings, Examination, Cross-Examination, Relevance, Sexual History<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. Both parties will have an opportunity to participate in a live hearing. At the University’s<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>discretion, the hearing may be conducted virtually with technology enabling participants to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>simultaneously see and hear each other or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>with all parties physically present in the same geographic location. The University may<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>also conduct the live hearing with some participants in the same geographic location, and<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>others virtually, so long as both parties are provided the same opportunity (if any) to be<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>present in the same geographic location..<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>2. During the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) will make an objective evaluation of all<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>relevant evidence – including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence – and ensure<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>that credibility determinations may not be based on a person’s status as a complainant,<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>respondent, or witness.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>3. The decision-makers shall not draw an inference solely based upon a party’s or witness’s<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>failure or refusal to appear at live hearing or submit to cross-examination.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>4. Where a party or a witness does appear at live hearing, the decision-maker shall only rely<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>on statements of that party or witness if she/he submits to cross-examination. .<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>5. At the live hearing, the decision-maker(s) must permit each party’s advisor to ask the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>other party and any witnesses all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>those challenging credibility. Cross-examination at the live hearing must be conducted<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>directly, orally, and in real time by the party’s advisor of choice and never by a party<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>personally.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>6. Only relevant cross-examination and other questions may be asked of a party or witness.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Before a complainant, respondent, or witness answers a cross-examination or other<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>question, the decision-maker(s) may issue a determination as to relevance and explain<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>any decision to exclude a question as not relevant.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>7. Questions and evidence about the complainant’s sexual predisposition or prior sexual<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>behavior are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence about the complainant’s<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>prior sexual behavior are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>committed the conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions or evidence<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior sexual behavior with respect to the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>respondent and are offered to prove consent.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>8. Strayer University will create an audio or audiovisual recording, or transcript, of any live<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review, without charge or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>fee, within a reasonably prompt timeframe.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>9. During the course of the hearing, the decision-maker(s) may consult with Strayer<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>University’s legal counsel by telephone or in person.</p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>G. Determination of Responsibility<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. The decision-maker(s), who shall not be the same person(s) as the Title IX Coordinator or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the investigator(s), will issue a written determination regarding responsibility.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>2. The standard of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>3. The decision-maker(s)’ written determination will include:<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The identification of the allegations potentially constituting Title IX Sexual<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Harassment as noticed.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• A description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the formal<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>complaint through the determination, including any notifications to the parties,<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>evidence, and hearings held.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• Findings of fact supporting the determination.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• Conclusions regarding the application of the institution’s code of conduct to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the facts.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each material allegation,<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>including a determination regarding responsibility, any disciplinary sanctions<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the institution imposes on the respondent, and whether remedies will be<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>provided by the institution to the complainant.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The institution’s procedures and permissible bases for the complainant and<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>respondent to appeal the determination of responsibility.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The institution will provide the written determination to the parties<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>simultaneously. The determination regarding responsibility becomes final<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>either on the date that the institution provides the parties with the written<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>determination of the result of the appeal, if an appeal is filed, or if an appeal is<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>not filed, the date on which an appeal would no longer be considered timely.</p> 
      <p>This constitutes the conclusion of the Title IX complaint resolution process.</p> 
      <p>IV. Appeal Process<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A. Both parties shall have the opportunity to appeal, via written request to Student Affairs within<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>ten (10) calendar days of being sent notice of the outcome, on the following basis:<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3. The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>B. If either party chooses to appeal the initial decision on any other basis, they must submit a<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>formal, written appeal request to Student Affairs. The appeal request must be submitted via<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>mail or email and within 10 calendar days of being sent notification of the panel’s decision.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. The president or president’s designee will receive and review the record developed at the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>investigation and review stage.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. Following the review, the president or president’s designee will issue a decision and<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>report. The president or president’s designee may affirm or reverse the decision, in whole<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>or in part, or may issue a new decision.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3. The decision of the president or president’s designee is final and will be communicated in<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>writing to the alleged victim and respondent simultaneously.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4. A record of the final decision and all related materials will become part of the respondent’s<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>official academic record and, upon request, will be made available to all Strayer University<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>boards and any appropriate regulatory bodies.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5. Strayer University employees and contractors are ineligible to appeal final decisions<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>rendered by the university’s Human Resources staff pursuant to this policy, except to the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>extent their appeal is made in their capacity as a Strayer University Student.</p> 
      <p>V. Summary Suspension Procedures<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A. Where the respondent is a Student and the alleged prohibited conduct is deemed to be<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>egregious or to give rise to a perceived threat of danger or hostile environment for any Strayer<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>faculty, staff, employee, contractor, or Student, a respondent may be immediately suspended<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>by use of this summary suspension process if it initially appears that the allegation of<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>prohibited conduct is substantiated. The university administrator directly associated with the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>course, activity, or event in which the prohibited conduct occurs will have the discretion to<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>determine, consistent with this section, when summary suspension is appropriate.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>B. If summary suspension is issued, the university administrator directly associated with the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>activity or event during which the alleged prohibited conduct occurred will promptly notify the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>respondent of their summary suspension and their right and opportunity to be heard by<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>submitting a written response and/or appearing by telephone within seven calendar days from<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the date said notification is issued.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>C. The university administrator directly associated with the activity or event during which the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>prohibited conduct occurred will complete the procedures set forth in section III within 10<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>calendar days of the date of issuance of the notification of summary suspension.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>D. The respondent may submit a written request for extension of time for their written response<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>or appearance by telephone beyond the seven calendar day deadline set forth in section IV.B.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Such extensions shall be automatically granted up to a maximum of 30 calendar days.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>However, in the event the respondent should exercise this right to an extension, the deadline<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>for the university official’s decision under section III will be extended by the length of the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Student’s extension, with the summary suspension remaining in effect the entire time.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"></span></p> 
      <p><span style="white-space: pre;">&nbsp; </span>E. Outcome<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1. In the event that the university administrator finds that the summary suspension was<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>justified, the process continues as described in section III, with the suspension remaining<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>in place unless and until reversed on appeal.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2. In the event that the university administrator finds that the evidence reviewed does not<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>justify the summary suspension, or in the event that no decision is issued by the university<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>administrator within the time constraints described in sections IV.C and IV.D, the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>summary suspension will expire. The process will continue as described in section III, but<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the respondent will return to the status previous to the summary suspension:<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• In this instance, the respondent will have an opportunity to complete the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>missed coursework within 10 calendar days of returning to the courseroom<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>without penalty.<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• If the respondent was in the last two weeks of the course, they have the option<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>of receiving an Incomplete (“I”) grade; in that case, the coursework must be<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>completed and submitted no later than two weeks after the course ends; or<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>• The respondent may choose to withdraw from the course and retake the<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>course without financial penalty or any penalty for reusing work previously<br> <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>submitted to fulfill assignments for that specific course.</p> 
      <p>VI. Alcohol and Drug Use Amnesty</p> 
      <p>The health and safety of every Student at Strayer is of utmost importance. Strayer recognizes that<br> students who have been drinking and/or using drugs (whether such use is voluntary or involuntary) at the<br> time sexual misconduct occurs may be hesitant to report such incidents due to fear of potential<br> consequences for their own conduct. Strayer strongly encourages students to report incidents of sexual<br> misconduct. A witness to or individual who experiences sexual misconduct, acting in good faith, who<br> discloses any incident of sexual misconduct to University officials or law enforcement will not be<br> sanctioned under Strayer’s code of conduct for violations of alcohol and/or drug use policies occurring at<br> or near the time of the incident(s) of sexual harassment or sexual violence. Strayer may request the<br> individual attend an approved alcohol or drug education program and without assessing any charges for<br> such program. This amnesty provision also applies to student groups making a report of sexual<br> misconduct.
