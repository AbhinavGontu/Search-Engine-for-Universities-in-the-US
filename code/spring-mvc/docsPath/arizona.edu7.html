To obtain the Certificate, students must complete a 12-unit program of study that includes core and thematic courses. The program is designed for students to begin in the fall and complete in one to two academic years. Students will be able to complete the Certificate in conjunction with a graduate or professional degree program or as a stand-alone certificate. The goal of the Certificate is to train graduate students and related professionals to be conversant with the problems of managing natural resources on American Indian reservations and off-reservation areas. We have outstanding resource management programs that are highly specialized at the University of Arizona, but we lack basic training for graduate or professional degree-seeking students who aim to work in the management and administration of Tribal natural resources. &amp;nbsp; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Advanced Clinical Pharmacy Practice Graduate Certificate Program The Advanced Clinical Pharmacy Practice Graduate Certificate Program is designed for international scholars who have graduated from a five or six-year pharmacy program (PharmD or equivalent) outside the United States. Currently we have a small cohort of students from universities, hospitals, and government agencies. Our program is designed to be completed in two to three years on a full-time basis. Successful graduates of the program go on to complete residencies in Arizona and other states as well as contribute to research and new knowledge in scholarly publications. Tailored Curriculum Designed for International Students Faculty and staff in the certificate program have worked with international students for more than 20 years. We are here to help you navigate the program application as well as support you through your academic, clinical and professional progression in areas such as advanced clinical training for residency, preparation for the licensure and English proficiency exams, and more. Program highlights Our staff and faculty in the certificate program are dedicated to international students and provide personalized support and training to meet individual needs of students. Over 30 pharmacy rotations with a different emphasis (e.g. internal medicine, infectious diseases, emergency medicine, and medication management) are available for students&amp;rsquo; clinical training. Approximately 90% of certificate program graduates move to PGY-1 residency and 80% to PGY-2 residency. </td>

The AIS M.A. focuses on three interrelated concepts: Centering Native peoples&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;The American Indian Studies Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (AIS GIDP) at UA centers Native peoples &amp;ndash; their knowledges, worldviews, perspectives, values, histories, experiences, lifeways, and futures &amp;ndash; within research, education, and service. The AIS GIDP seeks understanding&amp;nbsp;from an Indigenous perspective, placing Native ontologies, epistemologies, axiologies, methodologies, and pedagogies at the center of the intellectual effort to understand, teach about, and serve Indigenous communities. AIS GIDP&amp;nbsp;seeks to examine the world through an Indigenous perspective, utilizing Peoplehood as a primary disciplinary lens. Peoplehood&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;Conceptions of Peoplehood serve as a primary lens for understanding the commonalities and diversity of American Indian and Indigenous communities. Originally proposed by faculty and students in the UA Department of American Indian Studies in 2003, the concept of Peoplehood has become a critical lens for &amp;ldquo;rearticulating indigenous identity,&amp;rdquo; one that &amp;ldquo;offers the most promise in terms of its non-Western approach to identity, its flexibility, comprehensiveness, and allowance for cultural continuity and change&amp;rdquo; (Corntassel, 2003).&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Peoplehood&amp;rdquo; model represents their understanding of the interrelated components of indigeneity broadly, as well as the specificity and diversity of Indigenous communities in the U.S. and beyond. Community engagement and services&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Relational accountability&amp;rdquo; sits at the heart of Indigenous research and scholarship. This places an obligation on AIS as a discipline &amp;ndash; and the AIS GIDP &amp;ndash; to not just center Indigenous knowledges in our research and teaching, but to build relationships with Indigenous communities, to be accountable to those relationships and communities, and to contribute in tangible ways to the continued thriving of Native peoples.&amp;nbsp;What this engagement, accountability, and service will look like will vary greatly as each member of the faculty and each graduate student has a different area of focus and specialization.&amp;nbsp;The diversity of engagement and service only serves to underscore our collective commitment to supporting the many elements of Indigenous Peoplehood. Taken together, these commitments distinguish M.A. studies in American Indian Studies at UA as a discipline, and provide a theoretical model for the intellectual, pedagogical, and service work of the GIDP&amp;rsquo;s faculty and students. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The University of Arizona&amp;#39;s PhD in American Indian Studies &amp;ndash; the first such degree in the U.S. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp; is an interdisciplinary program designed to: Prepare graduate students for careers both within the academy and/or&amp;nbsp;in Native American governance, the nonprofit sector, philantropy, and/or government service; Conduct advanced and applied scholarly research from an Indigenous and cross-cultural perspective; Develop theoretical and innovative theories, methodologies, and research tools appropriate for and useful to sovereign tribes; and Educate students to assume leadership and policy-making roles in higher education, tribal communities, the state and nation.&amp;nbsp; The Ph.D. program is designed to be completed in 3-4 years (after completing the Master&amp;#39;s degree). The PhD program is based in a&amp;nbsp;commitment to three interrelated concepts: Centering Native peoples &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;The American Indian Studies Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (AIS GIDP) at UA centers Native peoples &amp;ndash; their knowledges, worldviews, perspectives, values, histories, experiences, lifeways, and futures &amp;ndash; within research, education, and service. The AIS GIDP seeks understanding from an Indigenous perspective, placing Native ontologies, epistemologies, axiologies, methodologies, and pedagogies at the center of the intellectual effort to understand, teach about, and serve Indigenous communities. AIS GIDP&amp;nbsp;seeks to examine the world through an Indigenous perspective, utilizing Peoplehood as a primary disciplinary lens. Peoplehood &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;Conceptions of Peoplehood serve as a primary lens for understanding the commonalities and diversity of American Indian and Indigenous communities. Originally proposed by faculty and students in the UA Department of American Indian Studies in 2003, the concept of Peoplehood has become a critical lens for &amp;ldquo;rearticulating indigenous identity,&amp;rdquo; one that &amp;ldquo;offers the most promise in terms of its non-Western approach to identity, its flexibility, comprehensiveness, and allowance for cultural continuity and change&amp;rdquo; (Corntassel, 2003).&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Peoplehood&amp;rdquo; model represents their understanding of the interrelated components of indigeneity broadly, as well as the specificity and diversity of Indigenous communities in the U.S. and beyond. Community engagement and services &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Relational accountability&amp;rdquo; sits at the heart of Indigenous research and scholarship. This places an obligation on AIS as a discipline &amp;ndash; and the AIS GIDP &amp;ndash; to not just center Indigenous knowledges in our research and teaching, but to build relationships with Indigenous communities, to be accountable to those relationships and communities, and to contribute in tangible ways to the continued thriving of Native peoples.&amp;nbsp;What this engagement, accountability, and service will look like will vary greatly as each member of the faculty and each graduate student has a different area of focus and specialization.&amp;nbsp;The diversity of engagement and service only serves to underscore our collective commitment to supporting the many elements of Indigenous Peoplehood. Taken together, these commitments distinguish PhD studies in American Indian Studies at UA as a discipline, and provide a theoretical model for the intellectual, pedagogical, and service work of the GIDP&amp;rsquo;s faculty and students. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Applicants to The University of Arizona&amp;rsquo;s Ph.D. program in Anthropology and Linguistics (ANLI) should have significant background in both linguistics and anthropology. The ANLI program makes it possible for students to pursue the study of language in its social context and linguistic theory, drawing on the resources of both the Department of Linguistics and the Linguistic Anthropology program within the School of Anthropology, without having to go through two separate Ph.D. programs. Potential applicants should clearly address in their statement of intent how their past experiences and future research interests fit with the current strengths of both departments. Both departments have strong national reputations for their contributions to the study of language, and each department has specialized in mutually compatible ways in the kinds of linguistic theory and analysis it offers students. The Department of Linguistics focuses on both formal and experimental models of language structure, including the study of Southwestern Native American languages and cultures, and historical linguistics. Linguistic Anthropology, as one of the four sub-disciplines within the field of anthropology, has concentrated on developing the study of language in its social context, particularly in sociolinguistics, including strong links with Cultural Anthropology. Scholars from both departments have also carried out research and fieldwork on numerous languages. The joint degree in Anthropology and Linguistics is designed for students with interests in both departments who would emerge from the program as job candidates for both linguistics and anthropology departments. Both the School of Anthropology and Department of Linguistics offer teaching assistantships and research support for students in the joint Ph.D. program. </td>

Non-anthropology major students can minor in anthropology in general, for which 12 units of anthropology courses are required; for these students, minoring in specific subfields or concentrations of anthropology is optional. Minor-field committees for students who are majoring in fields other than Anthropology may consist of one or two individuals, at least one of whom must be a core member of the faculty of the School of Anthropology. The minor-field portions of the written exam generally follow the procedures of the School of Anthropology, unless major and minor advisors reach another solution. Written exams will consist of one or two questions. The student will have one week to provide written answers of up to but no more than ten double-spaced pages per question. Note: students interested in using a minor to obtain a teaching certification at the community college level must take 24 units in Anthropology. </td>

Graduates of this track will be prepared for careers in controlled environment agriculture industry, academia and government. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The CEA is an agricultural production practice for year round continuous production of nutritionally high quality foods, with crop yields that can exceed field production by as much as 10-fold, and with the potentials to utilize local renewable energy resources, and optimize water, energy, space, capital, and labor resource use efficiency well above field traditional capabilities. This production technology, can employ crop production systems, provide harvest much less dependent of season, and can generate higher crop yields, quality, safety, nutritional value, with consistency and predictability, while utilizing less land in an environmentally friendly way. There has been significant advancement in agriculture due to enhanced cultivars by plant breeding, minimized use of chemicals and effects of pests by integrated pest management, improved production quality, produce uniformity and reduced labor via automation and mechanization. These continuous advancements in production practices and technology have maintained an acceptable food quality and low cost food supply, however, resulted in more demand for highly educated and skilled employees. The controlled environment agriculture systems are integrated systems consisting of hydroponics, mechanization and automation, climate control, production management processes which demand continuous system monitoring and control. Thus, technical understanding and crop production skills are needed for specific crop needs and through understanding of plant and microclimate interactions are needed so the systems can be effectively operated and precisely controlled to improve growth, production quality, and resource use efficiency. This necessitates potential graduates to acquire technical, production, management, people, business skills. Therefore, the CEA track will prepare students for rewarding employment in the controlled environment agriculture sector with technology, science and engineering, business and management oriented education and training to prepare current and future employees to meet the needs of this important industry segment to successfully compete in the global market place. </td>

Since ancient times, microorganisms have been utilized for what we now recognize as biotechnology applications, starting with beer and wine-making, leavening dough for bread and pastries, and preserving food by pickling.&amp;nbsp; The multibillion dollar modern fermentation and biocatalytic industries that grew out of these practices produce small molecule &amp;ldquo;natural products&amp;rdquo; to be used as drugs, pesticides and fine chemicals including biodegradable plastics, and provide us with amino acids, vitamins, solvents and other industrial chemicals.&amp;nbsp; Microbial fermentation and biocatalysis (the use of microorganisms as catalysts for chemical reactions) also represent our best hopes to produce sustainable, environmentally responsible biofuels, and constitute a fast growing segment of the biotechnology industry.&amp;nbsp; Microbial fermentation is also used to produce recombinant proteins as drugs or industrial enzymes, and can be used to manufacture antibodies and nucleic acids for diagnosis and treatment of diseases.&amp;nbsp; Drug discovery in the pharmaceutical and agribusiness industries, and the development of novel or cheaper industrial chemicals and reagents are unimaginable without utilizing microbial &amp;ldquo;chemical factories&amp;rdquo;. Microorganisms are also used for environmental biotechnology applications, utilizing the unrivaled ability of microbes to biodegrade a wide variety of compounds.&amp;nbsp; Bioremediation of contaminated former industrial sites, cleanup after natural disasters like oil spills, or everyday applications like waste water treatment rely on chemical reactions catalyzed on the spot by live microorganisms.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, integrated pest management in agribusiness can take advantage of biocontrol by live microorganisms to kill or suppress microbial, insect or nematode pests in an environmentally conscious manner that does not involve toxic chemicals. The IMB track will prepare students for gainful employment in the fermentation, biocatalysis, drug discovery and manufacture, agribusiness, chemical manufacture, and environmental biotechnology industries where experts with knowledge of microbiology, microbial genetics and biochemistry are in demand.&amp;nbsp; Just like other PSMAB tracks, the IMB track involves a strong component of developing professional skills and understanding the legal and business environment of these industries, and involves a required internship in a professional biotechnology laboratory environment. &amp;nbsp; </td>

The disciplines of microbiology and immunology started centuries ago with the development of the simple microscope (the 1600&amp;#39;s).&amp;nbsp; Using this new scientific tool and the seminal work by major microbiologist&amp;rsquo;s in the 1800&amp;rsquo;s, led to the vanquishing of the theory of spontaneous generation as the source of disease.&amp;nbsp; The ultimate cause of the disease was shown, using hypothesis-based scientific investigations, to be microorganisms or bacteria, and became known as &amp;ldquo;The Germ Theory&amp;rdquo; of disease.&amp;nbsp; These foundations in Medical Microbiology led to queries into how one could prevent disease by vaccination and by the use of antisera (antibody). These studies used antibodies raised against the bacterial toxins in animals. The antitoxin serum led to the use of passive immunization to protect and cure infectious diseases and vaccines against these deadly agents. This work was seminal in the development and futures discoveries in the field of immunology.&amp;nbsp; Major research and discoveries in the areas of medical microbiology and immunology have played a major part in the rapid advances in genomics, bioinformatics, and biotechnology. These technologies have also had a major impact on recent advancements in MMI. This program is unique in incorporating the MMI-biomedical science training along with the linking and integration of important knowledge from the disciplines of management, business, and law. All students in the PSM program are required to complete an internship, in our case, in the area of MMI. Students do internships with biotechnology companies based in the Tucson-Phoenix corridor, or in academic research laboratories, and obtain invaluable on-the-job training, experience, and knowledge.&amp;nbsp; This real world expertise obtained in the internship is unique and different from classroom learning or taking on-line courses. This innovative curriculum will give students the ability to take various career paths upon graduation. This could include doing research at &amp;ldquo;the bench&amp;rdquo;, to manage a laboratory at a university or in industry. With knowledge gained in business and legal fields, our trained scholars can also become involved in the business side of biomedical science.&amp;nbsp; Graduates from this track will be ready for such diverse professional vocations in the areas of: biotechnology, biomedical research, pharmaceuticals, local or national government, academic institutions, plus positions in immunologic and microbiologic biotechnology companies. The MMI subplan is working in alliance with the Certificate Program in Microbiology and Immunity (MIGCP) which is housed within the Department of Immunology.&amp;nbsp; Upon admission to the ABS MMI track, the 15 units completed by the student for the MIGCP certificate may be transferred as fulfillment of the Core Science and Science Electives Modules of the MMI subplan. </td>

Just as students in the existing tracks, SBB students will complete an internship at a company (preferably in the Tucson-Phoenix corridor) or at a UofA lab appropriate for their career goals, in order to obtain invaluable on-the-job training, experience and knowledge. This real world know-how obtained in the internship is unique and cannot be emulated in the classroom nor by taking on-line courses. As part of their graduate program, students will prepare, present and defend an internship report in lieu of a thesis (ABS is a non-thesis MS degree). This report will describe the field of research the student was engaged in; details their contributions to this field; and discusses future directions such research may take. Students graduating in the SBB program will typically do research during their professional career &amp;ldquo;at the bench&amp;rdquo; (including the &amp;ldquo;virtual bench&amp;rdquo; of the computer, in case of research in socioeconomic modeling), with the perspective of eventually managing a laboratory at a university or in industry. With knowledge gained in business and legal fields, our trained scholars can also become involved in the business side of the bioenergy industry, becoming project managers, regulatory agency employees, marketing and analysis professionals. </td>

The required coursework is drawn from the core curriculum of the Program in Applied Mathematics and the broad range of electives will enable them to develop mathematical expertise in application areas useful to their professional development. The certificate is primarily aimed at the professional community outside the University (e.g. employees in local companies). The certificate will provide additional professional qualifications to assist in their career development, and will help foster closer relations with the University. A successful Certificate experience may also encourage such professionals to enroll in the MS and PhD degrees in Applied Mathematics.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">PhD Minor for Applied Mathematics students The PhD degree at the University of Arizona is structured to have both a Major and a Minor. However, by completing the degree requirements for the&amp;nbsp;PhD in Applied Mathematics,&amp;nbsp;students simultaneously fulfill the requirements of the PhD minor in Applied Mathematics. However, students working on an interdisciplinary research topic and who want to highlight their knowledge in some area outside of mathematics may wish to investigate the possibilities of completing the minor requirements in that field. Not all departments offer a minor and requirements may vary. If the student has declared a minor outside of Applied Mathematics, the Comprehensive Exam Committee must include one faculty member representing the minor department. The representative of the minor department does not have to be a member of the Applied Mathematics Program but must be a tenure-track professor at that UA. Deciding whether to pursue a minor in another field and planning the timetable to complete its requirements is not always obvious and students are strongly encouraged to discuss the matter with their advisor and/or the Program Head. PhD Minor in Applied Mathematics for students in other degree programs Students in other graduate programs can earn a PhD minor in Applied Mathematics. The Applied Mathematics Program Head must approve an Applied Math minor form from the student before&amp;nbsp;the Doctoral Plan of Study is submitted in GradPath prior to the Comprehensive Exam.&amp;nbsp; Requirements are as follows: Completion of 12 units of approved course work in Applied Mathematics. Students should make sure that their proposed programs of coursework for the PhD minor are approved before they begin taking the courses. At least 6 of these units must be from the Applied Mathematics core sequence: (Math 527 a, b; Math 575 a, b; Math 583 a, b). Other courses taken should not be cross-listed with a 400-level course (please check the Course Catalog). Maintain better than a 3.0 GPA. There is no written exam requirement for the minor. Interested students should fill out an&amp;nbsp;application form&amp;nbsp;and forward it to&amp;nbsp;Stacey LaBorde(link sends e-mail)&amp;nbsp;in the Applied Math graduate office. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Applied Mathematics is an independent interdisciplinary graduate program with courses of study and research leading to Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Since it was started in 1976, the Interdisciplinary Program in Applied Mathematics at the University of Arizona has grown in size and stature and is now a highly regarded interdisciplinary graduate program, both nationally and internationally. The great strength of the Program lies in its large body of distinguished faculty who come from many different academic disciplines in the mathematical, physical, biological, and engineering and social sciences. The breadth and depth of endeavor has created a vital and exciting environment in which to work. By coming to Tucson you are opening yourself up for many opportunities: to feel the balance of theory, methods and algorithms in our core courses; to become involved in research and teaching of modern applied mathematics from your first day on campus;&amp;nbsp; to take specialized courses according to your interests and desires - in dynamical systems, complexity theory, bio-informatics, numerical analysis, machine learning, statistical mechanics or data science - as you need it in your research; to get hands-on experience in research internships with many of our industrial and government lab partners;&amp;nbsp; to choose an adviser from more than 100 professors teaching and advancing many areas of natural, engineering and social sciences through mathematics; to follow, understand and change boundaries of modern applied mathematics through your research work and teaching; to be well-positioned by the time of your graduation for many career options in academia, high-tech industry and national labs. Applicants must have an undergraduate background that contains a substantial mathematical component. The specific qualities we look for in applicants are informed both by our perspective of what constitutes modern applied mathematics and also by our past experience of student success. These qualities are broadly divided into four categories: (1) Mastery of the foundational&amp;nbsp;undergraduate material, specifically&amp;nbsp; (a) multivariable calculus, (b) linear algebra and (c) differential equations. (2) Aptitude for higher level mathematics as demonstrated by a selection of courses in advanced applied mathematical coursework, for example numerical methods, dynamical systems, complex analysis, PDEs, probability, stochastic processes, statistics, optimization, algorithms and mathematical physics.&amp;nbsp; (3) Solid command of theoretical mathematics, normally achieved via a full year of analysis or advanced calculus (if acquired at the undergraduate level).&amp;nbsp; (4) Commitment to excellence in mathematical research, as demonstrated by a high-quality undergraduate project, master&amp;#39;s thesis, or work experience. &amp;nbsp; We value applicants from many different&amp;nbsp;academic backgrounds. Some have undergraduate degrees specifically in applied math, and others have degrees in pure math,&amp;nbsp;physics, statistics, engineering or computer science. Additionally,&amp;nbsp;some come directly from their undergraduate degrees, some from masters programs, and others have several years of work experience in industry. Competitive applicants may be able to demonstrate proficiency in only three of the four categories&amp;nbsp;when they apply to the program. We expect all students to become proficient in all four categories by the end of the qualifying process (the qualifying process normally occurs during the first year).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Applicants are required to submit GRE general test scores, and are encouraged to submit GRE mathematics subject test scores. Please visit the Application Procedures page for instructions on how to apply. If you are a potential graduate student interested in obtaining a PhD and/or MS, or Certificate in Applied Mathematics, I hope you will find this information useful and stimulating.&amp;nbsp; Click here to&amp;nbsp;Request More Info, watch a Video about the Program, and here to&amp;nbsp;Apply to the Program.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Graduate Certificate in Archival Studies is designed to give students a solid grounding in the core knowledge of the archives and records management profession. The curriculum is structured around the guidelines for graduate programs set by the Society of American Archivists, ensuring that students will be competitive for jobs in a range of institutions possessing archival collections.&amp;nbsp; For graduate students in other degree programs, the Certificate will provide an opportunity to learn more about archival practices as they affect the composition and meaning of cultural artifacts and the historical record. In addition, the program will offer advanced continuing education opportunities to practitioners working in libraries and archives, especially on the challenges posed by the emerging of digital recordkeeping. Student Outcomes This program is built around the official guidelines of the Society of American Archivists (SAA) for graduate archival studies programs, which call for a minimum of 18 credits as a foundation for archives and records management professionals. Upon graduation, students will have a thorough grounding in the core knowledge of the profession, focusing on the nature of records and the basic archival functions of records appraisal, acquisition, arrangement, description, preservation, reference, access, outreach, and archives administration. Students will also gain essential contextual knowledge of the organizational, legal, and cultural factors shaping archival records as they are created and managed over time. </td>

Students are admitted to ABBS with no formal commitment to any of the participating degree- granting programs. All students perform three laboratory rotations (two in fall and one in spring) during the first year. Students are free to complete these rotations with any faculty member associated with the participating programs. This provides maximum flexibility for students to explore diverse fields of study. Students with identified goals can focus immediately on a particular research area and program. Upon completion of the third rotation (approximately nine weeks into the spring semester), students will select a faculty mentor and transition from ABBS to the degree-granting program associated with their faculty mentor.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The&amp;nbsp;Accelerated Master of Arts in Art History&amp;nbsp;provides an opportunity for high-achieving University of Arizona undergraduate students in the a BA in Art History or a BA in Studio Art to use 12 units of graduate coursework towards both their Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and Master&amp;rsquo;s degrees, giving students the possibility to receive both a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in 5 years. This program is intended both for students interested in enhancing their qualifications for careers in galleries, libraries, archives and museums, as well as for students interested in admission to other graduate programs (such as Library and Information Science, Conservation, and Arts Administration). Accelerated Master of Arts students must have an excellent academic record and the ability to balance their coursework in a face-paced program. Students will typically be invited by their art history professor to apply to the program. The Master of Arts degree in Art History provides a broad-based and methodologically critical foundation essential to pursuing a career in Art History, whether in a university or museum setting. The Art History faculty offers an extensive range of specialties, theoretical approaches, and methodologies. Students are encouraged to develop diverse critical methods and originality of thought as well as a thorough knowledge of the history of art. Graduate students may take advantage of course offerings in related departments such as Architectural History, History, Classics, Anthropology, Media Arts, Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies, Religious Studies, and English, among others. In addition, they may participate in the activities of the African-American Studies Program, the American Indian Studies Program, the Southwest Institute for Research on Women, the Latin American Area Center, the University of Arizona Medieval, Renaissance, and Reformation Committee, and the Group for Early Modern Studies Graduate Certificate Program.

The AMP is well suited for students who aim to gain research experience at the graduate level, and are interested in pursuing a career in atmospheric sciences. This program is currently open only to students doing a Bachelor of Science in Physics. This program is not open to students who have completed a Bachelor degree or an advanced degree from another institution. &amp;nbsp; Overview AMP students focus on completing undergraduate-level courses during their first three years. By December of the junior year students must submit an online application to the AMP program. Upon acceptance to the Accelerated Masters Program, students continue to fulfill undergraduate requirements during the Spring of the junior year including the required AMP course &amp;quot;PHYS436a&amp;quot;. Students then take a combination of undergraduate and graduate courses in the fourth year to complete their Bachelor of Science degree. During this time, the students also begin to develop their research ideas in preparation for graduate-level research. In the fifth and final year, students focus on graduate course work and their research-based thesis/manuscript in order to complete the requirements for the Master of Science degree.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Bilingual Journalism The master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Bilingual Journalism is a cutting-edge program that offers professional and academic training for students who want to report about and/or for Latinx communities in the United States and abroad. It is one of the only fully bilingual programs in the country. Graduates will acquire a robust set of skills in both Spanish and English that will translate into a significant competitive edge in the workplace. Students must be fluent in English and Spanish or English and Portuguese.&amp;nbsp;Innovation and new models of storytelling in the digital age also set this master&amp;rsquo;s degree apart from other programs. Students will explore entrepreneurial models of journalism, such as crowd-funding and nonprofit or donor-based hyperlocal and translocal projects. In addition, students will practice innovative ways of reporting and disseminating news for non-legacy media by incorporating the conversational style of the internet, social media, community engagement and advanced understanding of their audiences. This program is offered by the School of Journalism in collaboration with the Center of Latin American Studies, the Department of Mexican American Studies and the Department of Spanish &amp;amp; Portuguese. It is designed for students who have a journalism background as well as those who have no previous journalism experience. Part-time students are welcome. </td>

Students in BME or similar Engineering or Life Sciences majors are encouraged to apply. (Please check with your undergrad major to ensure use of units will apply to degree) General requirements for Accelerated Master&amp;#39;s Programs are set by the office of Academic Affairs, and can be found here. Most importantly, the Accelerated Master&amp;rsquo;s Program is not designed to accelerate progress towards a Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering.&amp;nbsp; The intent of the AMP is to provide students with a terminal M.S. degree that they can then use to accelerate their careers in industry or medical research institutions.&amp;nbsp; The AMP program is not a stepping-stone for obtaining a B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degree within 7 years, which is an unlikely scenario within our program. Students who are interested in a Ph.D. degree should consider the Ph.D. program rather than the AMP, as only the units taken after Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree is awarded can be used toward Ph.D total unit requirement. Qualified students apply to the program nominally in the second semester of their junior year (i.e. with two full semesters remaining in their undergraduate program).&amp;nbsp; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Eller Executive MBA program&amp;nbsp;(located at the downtown Phoenix, AZ campus)&amp;nbsp;consists of 19, eight‐week courses delivered in a lock‐step hybrid format. The program provides both an online and in-person component. Course content is provided online, with students meeting for in-person classes one weekend per month at the Phoenix, AZ campus to:&amp;nbsp; - attend guest speaker sessions - take a deeper dive into content presented online - work together in teams and deliver presentations, or - engage in simulation exercises, etc. In addition to the hybrid courses, students are required to attend a pre-program orientation session at the Phoenix, AZ campus, plus a three-day residential session at the Tucson, AZ campus. Travel during the program is also required: - Global Business Experience - 7-day international travel (program and lodging included with tuition, airfare not included) - Silicon Valley Immersion - 3-day domestic travel (program and lodging included with tuition, airfare not included) The program includes group work that will involve students meeting with other students, either in person or remotely. Working well within teams will be required for successful completion of the program. Staying on site, in Phoenix overnight, for in-person class weekends, allows the Executive MBA student&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;focus on&amp;nbsp;academic and&amp;nbsp;networking experiences. Many students comment that the close-knit community, which develops through the course of the program, is one of its greatest strengths. &amp;nbsp; </td>

Five of our faculty have won National Science Foundation Young Investigator Awards, and two have received American Society of Civil Engineers Huber Prizes. We also boast two ASCE Distinguished Members.&amp;nbsp; As a result, our graduate program is ranked 40th out of 141 civil engineering graduate programs in the 2017 U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report &amp;ndash; even as the second-smallest department in the top 50. &amp;nbsp; Our group of 10 research faculty produced 35 ISI journal publications in 2016. We have been accredited as a testing laboratory for fiber-reinforced polymer materials, conducting a large-scale testing regime.&amp;nbsp; The doctoral program is designed to prepare a professional engineer for senior responsibility in industry, research, or teaching. The successful candidate must demonstrate the ability to devise and execute a program of study and research, which makes a fundamentally new contribution to the chosen field. The most important aspect of the doctoral program is the dissertation, which is the evidence of this fundamental contribution. The student should be prepared for a very demanding period of study beyond the master&amp;rsquo;s degree. A minor field may be selected from architecture, chemistry, environmental engineering, geology, mathematics, mechanical engineering, materials science and engineering, mining engineering, nuclear engineering, physics, or systems engineering, or from within the Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics. Still other fields are available as minors with the approval of the head of the department.&amp;nbsp; At the option of the department, a Master of Science degree may be awarded to candidates for the Doctor of Philosophy degree who have passed the comprehensive examination, provided they write a thesis or engineering report.&amp;nbsp; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The University of Arizona&amp;#39;s Clinical &amp;amp; Translational Research (ACTR) graduate certificate program prepares interprofessional scientists for the complexities of clinical &amp;amp; translational research through high-quality didactic instruction, and mentored collaborative research experiences. The mission of the ACTR is to educate interprofessional scholars in collaborative methods and techniques for clinical and translational research, and to provide them with the tools necessary to become independent clinical researchers who will contribute to the advancement of biomedical science and the improvement of healthcare. Clinical and translational research is fundamental for prevention, treatment, diagnosis and relief of symptoms of disease in human populations. Worldwide, there is an increasing need for highly qualified clinical researchers. The ACTR graduate certificate program has a&amp;nbsp;strong track record&amp;nbsp;for training interprofessional translational clinical researchers. &amp;ldquo;I completed the program in 2004. This program changed my career for the better in all domains. First, it gave me the fundamental skill sets to become an independent investigator and start meaningful research efforts. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine an academic physician being able to progress through a career without these skills! Second, it provided the knowledge needed to become an effective learner and teacher of medicine based on current medical literature. Evidence based medicine is not easy &amp;ndash; it requires a solid understanding of biostatistical and epidemiology concepts. Most importantly, the program introduced me to an enormous number of collaborators and mentors that I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to work with. Priceless!&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Sam M. Keim, MD, MS This innovative training program integrates the knowledge and expertise of faculty and staff within the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, Arizona Health Sciences Center, and other University of Arizona departments. The interprofessional approach provides opportunities for program scholars to acquire fundamental clinical &amp;amp; translational research skills in a supportive environment. This graduate certificate program can be successfully completed through taking courses in person or online or in a hybrid fashion of online and in person course work. The complete online training program and the hybrid training program have been specially designed to increase the accessibility of ACTR to busy health professionals and distant learners. ACTR scholars may complete this program in one year (in-person) or two years (online). </td>

Its fundamental goal is to determine the nature of human intelligence, and to define what is required of a physical system to produce behaviors ordinarily deemed &amp;quot;intelligent&amp;quot;. Pursuit of typical problems (reasoning, language comprehension, visual recognition) involves the integration of disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science. The Program includes a state funded research unit and awards a Ph.D. minor. Students usually enroll in the Ph.D. program of a cooperating discipline; the minor is then designed in consultation with Cognitive Science Program faculty. The Program has special strength in knowledge structure, natural language processing, and cognitive neuroscience. More than 50 faculty from 13 departments, and the following University-wide units participate in the Program: the Center for Complex Systems Study, the Cognitive Neuroscience Center, the Institute for Neurogenic Communicative Disorders, and the Neural Systems, Memory and Aging Center.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Like many institutions this year, the University of Arizona is facing significant financial stress.&amp;nbsp; The College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, where the Creative Writing Program is housed, is not able to fund graduate assistantships for new students entering in Fall 2021.&amp;nbsp; While we&amp;#39;re hopeful that the financial picture could brighten, Creative Writing may not know of a change to this situation before the height of admissions season.&amp;nbsp; Regretfully, without certainty in financial support from the College, we are suspending admissions for the 21-22 cycle.&amp;nbsp; If you applied for admission to the Creative Writing graduate program for Fall 2021 before October 15th, 2020, please contact the Director of the Creative Writing Program (Manuel Mu&amp;ntilde;oz, munozm@arizona.edu) to arrange a refund of your application fee.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Highlights: * A fully funded three-year program. (See our press release for the shift to the three-year MFA here.) * Students have funding opportunities for research and travel via the departmental English Graduate Union, the Graduate and Professional Student Council, Confluence Center and the Institute of the Environment, among other organizations. * Three genres: Poetry, fiction and nonfiction, with active encouragement to work across genres. * The opportunity to apply to teach creative writing at the undergraduate level. * Excellent student-teacher ratio (11 faculty for 36 students). * An active series of visiting writers and editors. * A challenging, supportive and dynamic atmosphere in a culturally vibrant, progressive border city. * An extremely active and critically acclaimed faculty. * MFA thesis defense that may include outside readers. Past outside readers have included such writers as Jenny Boully, Gary Paul Nabhan, Steven Church, Lu&amp;iacute;s Alberto Urrea, and Kim Stanley Robinson. * The lushest desert in the world with mountains all around. The M.F.A. in Creative writing Since 1972, the University of Arizona has offered one of the preeminent MFA programs in the country for the study of creative writing. With workshops and craft seminars in fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, we offer intensive instruction in literary craft and the study of literature from a writer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, as well as opportunities to strengthen professional skills and flourish as a writer. The program requires three years in residence, the completion of 42 academic units, including four workshops in one genre and four craft courses, one of which must be outside of your genre. A student&amp;rsquo;s studies culminate in the production of an aesthetic statement and a thesis manuscript. The program is fully funded, with assistantships in teaching composition offered to all incoming MFA students. You have the opportunity to apply to teach creative writing in your second year. Assistantships include salary, health insurance and a complete tuition waiver. A writer engages in the world. With this in mind, we invite students to develop a course of study parallel to the page, whether it is in the University, the city of Tucson, the Sonoran desert, or beyond. You have the chance to volunteer with and/or have a for-credit internship with such organizations as the UA Poetry Center, Sonora Review, Fairy Tale Review, Diagram, New Michigan Press, The Volta, Letter Machine Editions, Edible Baja Arizona, terrain.org, Spork Press, Kore Press, Field Studies in Writing, and the poetry collective POG. The literary community here is strong. Please look into the offerings at the Poetry Center, our partner in many adventures. In addition to the Poetry Center&amp;nbsp;Readings &amp;amp; Lectures Series, the creative writing faculty curates the&amp;nbsp;UA Prose Series, which brings in four writers a year. MFA students run the Works-in-Progress&amp;nbsp;(WIP)&amp;nbsp;Reading Series, the Salon Series (conversations about the writing life between students, faculty, and others) and Infuse, a cooperative reading and art series between creative-writing and visual-arts MFA students. The University of Arizona is the home to the&amp;nbsp;Sonora Review, one of the oldest student-run literary magazines in the country. Every year, the program sends out the Look Book to agents and editors, introducing them to our current graduating class&amp;rsquo; work. For more information, please investigate our Student Guide, as well as Alumni News. And perhaps the best advertisement for the program is the work of our recent graduates. The MFA Look Book, published by the program every two years, is sent to editors, agents, influential literary people, and friends of the program each year. But you can check it out for free here.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Master of Fine Arts in Dance provides an opportunity to increase knowledge, broaden understanding, and develop research and artistic capability. Building on a well-balanced undergraduate education, graduate students are expected to develop a thorough understanding of the specific discipline of dance, supported by a personal commitment to high scholarly and artistic standards. A fundamental purpose of the School of Dance is to encourage each graduate student to demonstrate outstanding standards of scholarship and to produce high-quality original research and creative work. The diverse graduate population provides a sense of community in which students can learn from various perspectives. In addition, the close alliance between the graduate and undergraduate students provides an opportunity for graduate students to choreograph on and perform with some of the top undergraduate dance students in the country. The triple-track program allows the graduate student to explore and gain experience, skills, and knowledge in ballet, modern, and jazz dance. Unique to the University of Arizona School of Dance MFA program is the opportunity to choreograph a fully produced thesis concert featuring your fellow graduate students and undergraduate dancers. All graduate students are eligible to perform masterworks set on the UA Dance Ensemble. Recent masterwork&amp;nbsp;choreographers include George Balanchine, Nacho Duato, Larry Keigwin, Martha Graham, Christopher Wheeldon, Jos&amp;eacute;&amp;nbsp;Lim&amp;oacute;n, Darrell Grand&amp;nbsp;Moultrie, Jerome Robbins&amp;nbsp;and Jessica Lang. The UA School of Dance also provides many opportunites for community outreach performances at venues such as Diamond Children&amp;#39;s Hospital and&amp;nbsp;Tucson Museum of Art. Graduates from the MFA program are teaching professionally at all levels.&amp;nbsp;Many&amp;nbsp;have gone on&amp;nbsp;to become Professors at&amp;nbsp;Universities and Colleges throughout the US and Canada, while many others are teaching K-12, at conservatories, and at dance studios both nationally and internationally.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, many have gone on to work in a variety of positions in professional dance companies. These positions include founder, director, artistic director, rehearsal director and performer. &amp;nbsp;https://dance.arizona.edu/people/our-alumni/ &amp;nbsp; </td>

Information on requirements and procedures for admission is available from the Graduate College and the department. The department may admit a student with a B.A. directly into one of the Ph.D. programs if that student shows exceptional promise in his or her field and if there is strong backing from at least one faculty member. In such cases, the student is responsible for fulfilling all normal requirements for the appropriate M.A. program before beginning work for the Ph.D. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Professional Science Master&amp;#39;s in Economic Geology (PSM/EG) is a post-graduate education and training program designed to provide geologists with the technical and leadership skills required by mineral industries around the globe. Candidates are usually professionals who have a Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in Geosciences or a related field&amp;nbsp;and a job in the minerals industry but wish to obtain further education and training that will allow them to compete globally with other professionals for career-track positions leading to management opportunities. &amp;nbsp; The PSM/EG covers a broad spectrum of mining-related activities, from discovery, to production, to mine closure. This program emphasizes technical aspects but also includes essential business and management components. The program can be completed in two semesters if the student is efficient and can focus entirely on completing the degree, but flexibility is available to purse the degree over a somewhat longer period of time while working locally part time. The PSM/EG has&amp;nbsp;degree requirements that differ from those of a conventional MS degree in Geosciences. The course requirements are not identical. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The four emphasis areas (degree tracks) are identified below: Exploration geology: For those students interested in pursuing a career in discovering new ore deposits, generally working in teams dominated by geoscientists. Development geology: For those geologists who will be testing the feasibility of deposits, bringing newly discovered deposits into production, and expanding existing operations, typically as a member of a multi-disciplinary project team.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Mining geology: For&amp;nbsp;those geologists who will be contributing to the efficient mining and processing of ore at operating mines, generally as a member of the professional staff at an operating mine. Environmental geology: For those geologists who will&amp;nbsp;be applying geologic science to&amp;nbsp;the environmental aspects of the mining industry, such as permitting new mines or monitoring and controlling water quality and supply in the vicinity of active and closed mining operations, typically as a member of an environmental team at&amp;nbsp;a mine site, a member of&amp;nbsp;a corporate environmental staff, or&amp;nbsp;an employee of an environmental consulting firm. </td>

Graduates are able to adapt to a changing world, predict consequences of actions, and sustain continuous education improvements over time. Individuals develop skills and qualities that enhance their ability to empower, inspire, and guide the performance of others in achieving the goals of a school, a school district, or a community. Educational Specialist degrees may be awarded to students who are admitted by the Graduate College upon the recommendation of the College of Education, and who satisfactorily complete program requirements specified by the departments in the College of Education offering this degree. No more than 20 percent of the minimum number of units required for a master&amp;#39;s degree can be transferred from other accredited institutions (e.g., if a Specialist degree requires 60 units, then no more than 12 units can be transferred from another university). Such transfer credit can be applied to an advanced degree only upon satisfactory completion of deficiencies as prescribed by the head of the major department in which the student seeks a degree. Transfer of credit toward an advanced degree will not be made unless the grade earned was A or B, and unless it was awarded graduate credit at the institution where the work was completed. Grades of transfer work will not be used in computing the student&amp;#39;s grade-point average. Credit for correspondence courses or extension work from other institutions will not be accepted for graduate credit. &amp;nbsp; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">For nearly 30 years, the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition has conducted archaeological research in Egypt. This certificate will serve to increase awareness of this unique opportunity for UA and non-UA graduate students and non-degree seeking professionals. Indeed, no other college or university in the country offers such a focused graduate program specifically in Egyptian archaeology. The conduct of archaeological research varies widely from one country to another. Not only do the ancient sites differ, but each country&amp;nbsp;(or geographic discipline)&amp;nbsp;also presents fieldworkers and other researchers with its own cultural settings, standard practices, and official regulations. Thus study of the practicalities of conducting archaeological research in Egypt and Sudan, and&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Egyptological museum collections, merits its own concentrated study at the post-graduate level. For this reason, the University of Arizona is pleased to offer this post-graduate program in Egyptian archaeology. This program will aid participants in their careers by providing training and requiring demonstration of competence in the following core areas, among others: 1) archaeological field methods as used in Egypt and/or Sudan; 2) interpretation of material culture in the conditions encountered in Egypt and/or Sudan; 3) the preparation of research proposals, permit requests, and required reports; 4) the preparation of grant proposals for the conduct of archaeological research, especially fieldwork. &amp;nbsp; The graduate certificate is intended as a supplement to master&amp;#39;s and doctoral programs (be they at Arizona or elsewhere), providing a specific focus on the planning, implementation, and publication of archaeological research in Egypt, Sudan, or related museum collections. The typical participant in the certificate program will be either currently enrolled in graduate-level study in a related field (e.g., Egyptology, Near Eastern Studies, Art History, Ancient History) or have recently completed an advanced degree. Professionals in related fields are also encouraged to apply. The program is not intended as an introduction and will not accept novices. </td>

These challenges require innovative entomological research to address conservation&amp;nbsp;of biodiversity, and to mitigate potential increases in negative impacts of invasive species and harm&amp;nbsp;caused by insect pests and insect vectors to crops, structures, and human health. The program thus&amp;nbsp;bridges the gap between basic research, using insects as models to address general biological questions,&amp;nbsp;and applied research affecting humankind more directly.

Student presentations at meetings and student publications are likewise encouraged. Numerous workshops on topics ranging from the Internet to scientific writing are regularly available. In addition to graduate student-sponsored activities, various departmental events, such as departmental picnics and weekly seminars, provide students with opportunities to meet and socialize with colleagues. With a M.S. in Soil, Water and Environmental Science students will be prepared for careers in business and industry, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and private consulting firms. NOTE:&amp;nbsp; Beginning Spring 2021, ENVS will offer the MS with a major in Environmental Science; the major in Soil, Water and Environmental Science will no longer be offered.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Note: the name of this program was recently shortened from Soil, Water and Environmental Science to Environmental Science.&amp;nbsp; Program requirements are identical. The UA Department of Environmental Science, ENVS, offers graduate work leading to Ph.D. degree in Soil, Water and Environmental Science. Two tracks are offered, &amp;quot;Environmental Science&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Soil and Water Science&amp;quot;. In addition to the major, each Ph.D. student must complete a minor, which can be intra- or interdepartmental. Many, if not most, ENVS graduate students enroll in several non-ENVS courses as part of their program. This reflects the multi-disciplinary characteristics of the ENVS program in general, and also that a minor is required for all Ph.D. students. The most frequently used outside courses are in Chemistry, Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Hydrology and Water Resources, and Microbiology. Once enrolled in the ENVS graduate degree program, students may concurrently pursue a Graduate Certificate in Water Policy. There is flexibility in both course selection and schedule, to meet the specific needs and interests of a variety of students. The program is interdisciplinary. The department also offers two dual degree options:&amp;nbsp; the Master of Science in Soil, Water and Environmental Science and a Master of Arts in Journalism; and a dual Ph.D. in Soil, Water and Environmental Science and MBA from the Eller College of Management.&amp;nbsp; Graduates with the dual MS/MA degrees would be able to make important contributions not only to discussions within news organizations about the ways in which information about science should be gathered and evaluated, but also discussions in the fields of science and journalism about the ways in which this information influences public perceptions and public policy, and therefore the effects of science on society.&amp;nbsp; Those with the dual Ph.D./MBA would be prepared for science-related careers in industry and government that require understanding of development, production and regulation, as well as skills in management and leadership. The ENVS department strongly supports attendance at professional meetings. Student presentations at meetings and student publications are likewise encouraged. Numerous workshops on topics ranging from the Internet to scientific writing are regularly available. In addition to graduate student-sponsored activities, various departmental events, such as departmental picnics and weekly seminars, provide students with opportunities to meet and socialize with colleagues. With the Ph.D.in Soil, Water, and Environmental Science, students will be prepared for careers in business and industry, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and private consulting firms. Many Ph.D. students obtain faculty positions at colleges and universities. Electronic copies of Dissertations and Master&amp;#39;s Theses may be accessed through the UA Campus Repository. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The PhD in Epidemiology is offered by the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Epidemiology is the scientific discipline concerned with the causes and prevention of human disease. Epidemiology focuses on the occurrence of disease among human populations, considering changes within populations over time and differences among and between populations in disease risk. Epidemiologists today are involved in attempts to understand the causes and means of controlling AIDS and other infectious diseases, as well as chronic diseases including cancer and coronary heart disease. Much of our understanding of the links between sexual practices and AIDS risk, of smoking and cancer, of serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease, of obesity and mortality risk and of air pollution and chronic lung disease derives from epidemiologic studies. The PhD in Epidemiology trains individuals for careers in research and teaching in academic settings, research institutes, government agencies and industry. It has been designed for students whose careers will focus on conducting investigator-initiated and collaborative epidemiologic research. On average, the doctoral program requires approximately four to five years for completion. The first two years of this time are usually devoted to coursework, the qualifying exam, the comprehensive doctoral examinations, and development of doctoral research. The program is research oriented and centers on a major research project. At least 46 credits are required for the major (including up to 10 units of independent study), plus a minimum of 18 dissertation units (EPID 920), and at least 9 units minimum for the minor (depending on minor department requirements). Consult the course listings for further details on specific course requirements and schedules. The overall course of study will be developed by the student and the advisor and approved by the student&amp;#39;s Graduate Committee and Chair of the Epidemiology Section.

Other elements of the doctoral program are the research mentorship program, research methods and statistics courses, and the doctoral dissertation. Through the doctoral program, a student will acquire a firm foundation in theory and research methods relevant to their emphasis area and will also become competent in advanced statistical techniques necessary for conducting research. A primary expectation for all entering graduate students (including international students) is that their written communication skills in the English language are at an appropriate level for the graduate program. Therefore, students should possess appropriate knowledge of, and proficiency in, academic formal writing, including mastery of English grammar and punctuation, ability to organize ideas, and logical presentation of ideas. Students wishing to hone skills in writing may avail themselves of a variety of graduate writing tutorials, institutes, and workshops offered by the Graduate College (see https://grad.arizona.edu/new-and-current-students). In addition, the Center for English as a Second Language (CESL) offers an academic writing/speaking course, ENGL 407, for nonnative speakers/writers.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Graduate Programs in French Working together with their Faculty Advisor, the Director of Graduate Studies, and other faculty members, MA students at the University of Arizona have the flexibility to construct a Plan of Study that suits their own particular needs and interests. The Plan of Study may include, but is not limited to, one of the following emphases: (1) French Literature and Culture, (2) Teaching French as a Foreign Language, and (3) Francophone Studies. Students normally proceed through the M.A. program in four semesters. Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GATships) are typically available although they are contingent on budget, academic records (for incoming students), and reports of satisfactory progress (for continuing students). We also offer a one-year exchange assistantship with the University of Paris VII (Denis Diderot) and a one-semester exchange with the University of Paris IV (Sorbonne). When all requirements are met and funds are sufficient, graduate students may receive support for four semesters as a GAT. An additional semester of support is available in special circumstances. Entering students normally teach two courses per semester, unless course releases are obtained. All GATships include non-resident tuition waivers. Summer teaching positions are available for advanced students at the UA and with the Arizona in Paris summer program. We also have an exchange with the University of Paris (VII). The graduate program offers courses on French and Francophone literatures and cultures in all major areas of the French tradition as well as literature in French from the Maghreb, Lebanon, West and Central Africa and the Caribbean. The department&amp;#39;s courses on French and Francophone literatures and culture deal with current debates on topics that include identity, canon formation, the discipline and its history, and Francophonie, while presenting the classics in their historical and cultural contexts. The faculty employs a range of methods drawing on feminism, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, history and postcolonial theory among others. Likewise, students are encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary approaches and often enroll in courses in related fields such as Women&amp;#39;s studies, English and Anthropology to name just a few of the options. Faculty in the department also offer graduate courses on second language acquisition, pedagogy and linguistics and contribute to the M.A. program in French and to the interdisciplinary doctoral program in Second-Language Acquisition and Teaching. Through course work and research in French and in related disciplines students gain an extensive knowledge of literary and cultural texts; a thorough understanding of field-specific and field-related methods, criticism, and theories; and the ability to integrate that knowledge into their own research. In addition to being trained as independent critics and scholars, M.A. candidates in French also undergo formal training as teachers that will serve them well on the job market and/or in their applications to Ph.D. programs. While the recommended deadline for Fall admission is January 15, we will continue to review applications until all openings are filled. </td>

DUAL DEGREE IN GENDER AND &amp;amp; WOMEN&amp;rsquo;S STUDIES AND THE COLLEGE OF LAW The MA is only offered with the Dual Degree program, this is not a stand alone MA program.&amp;nbsp; The M.A./J.D. in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies prepares students to practice law with an understanding of feminist theories, feminist and related social movements, and critical race and ethnic studies, as well as the interconnections of gender, law, public policy, and transnational economic and political processes. Students&amp;#39; understanding of feminist praxis is enriched through internships and other practice-oriented activities supervised by core GWS faculty and GWS affiliates in the Law School. The program enables students to build on these foundations while pursuing their own areas of interest by requiring them to produce an original Master&amp;#39;s paper. The MA/JD is generally a four-year program. The M.A./J.D. is generally a four-year program, although several students have accumulated enough units to graduate one semester early. A minimum of 21 units of graduate coursework in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies, plus 15 units of approved law coursework are required for the 36-unit M.A. in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies. Students may transfer up to 15 units of GWS courses and seminars toward the J.D. Students attend either Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies or The College of Law their first year. The second year is spent in the alternate program. Students would then complete their requirements for both degrees throughout the third and fourth years. Courses taken in Gender and Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies prior to admission to The College of Law cannot be applied to the J.D. Dual degree applicants must meet the application deadlines and testing requirements for each program independently.

Through coursework and preparation for individually designed comprehensive exams, students gain understanding and skills in diverse approaches to feminist scholarship that enable them to design and complete their own innovative dissertation project. The department has particular expertise in Chicana/Latina studies, LGBTQ/Sexuality Studies, transnationalism, and representation and culture and maintains methodologically diverse approaches to scholarship. Through its affiliation with the Southwest Institute for Research on Women the department also contributes to applied community-based research on women&amp;#39;s and adolescent health, substance abuse treatment, women and incarceration, and projects related to border issues. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Currently, students are admitted to the Ph.D. program and to the MS program &amp;nbsp; The University of Arizona has a rich history of genetics research, representing the entire range of model, experimental, and applied biological systems. Geneticists at the University of Arizona study genetic model organisms &amp;ndash; such as Drosophila and yeasts &amp;ndash; the genetics of crop plants and animals of agricultural importance, microbial genetics and virology, evolutionary and conservation genetics, and of course the genetics of human beings and their families with a focus on how their genetics relate to health and disease. Our faculty&amp;rsquo;s research is highly impactful, and we are internationally recognized for innovative work, often covering many branches of knowledge within genetics and integrating with &amp;ldquo;non-genetic&amp;rdquo; fields of biology. Our investigators collaborate often, with others at the University of Arizona and with others across the United States and throughout the world. The study of genes, their functions, their interactions, and their inheritance will prepare you for a wide variety of possible careers. Your training at the University of Arizona will prepare you for life-long learning and high impact research in all of the biological and biomedical fields because the concepts of genetics inform all other areas of research. Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs - http://gidp.arizona.edu/ The Graduate College sponsors several Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs (GIDPs) in addition to the many interdisciplinary possibilities available through regular graduate degree programs. GIDPs transcend departmental boundaries by facilitating cutting edge teaching and research at the nexus of traditional disciplines. The high value placed on interdisciplinary research and education is indicative of The University of Arizona&amp;#39;s enthusiasm and commitment to fostering innovation and creativity among its faculty and students. Students must complete a total of 63 semester units of coursework in the major and minor subject areas in order to complete the degree: Major. 36 units of coursework, combining units from the core curriculum and units from the student&amp;#39;s specific area of interest as detailed in the PoS. Other units come from independent study and research credits. Minor. No less than 9 units of coursework as required by the graduate program in which the student is minoring. Dissertation units. At least 18 units of GENE 920 dissertation credit are taken after successful completion of the comprehensive examinations. The Genetics Program has one required genetics course CMM 518 Fundamental Genetic Mechanisms. This three-credit course help in the fall semester covers a broad range of topics in science of heredity and genetics of DNA and chromosome transactions. Students learn to analyze and evaluate the primary literature, to solve complex problems in genetics, and to present oral communications of and to prepare written reports of old and new concepts in genetics. Genetics Program students must select additional courses to complete their PoS. Courses are generally at the will of the student and the student&amp;rsquo;s advisory committee. However, to assure sufficient breadth for the students of the Genetics Program, students must choose one course from each of two of three lists, determined by the Genetics Curriculum Committee and maintained on the Genetics GIDP web page. The three lists are broadly divided into three categories: Organismal Genetics; Biochemistry; Genomics, Informatics, and Population Genetics. For example, a student must pass CMM518, and one course from Organismal Genetics, and one from Biochemistry, or he or she may pass CMM518 and one from Organismal Genetics and one from Genomics, Informatics, and Population Genetics. The inclusion of a new course offered by the University on one of the lists can be done by your advisor by contacting the Genetics Curriculum Committee, the Chair, or the Vice-Chair of the GIDP. Students are required to take an ethics course in their first year. To satisfy this requirement, students may take MCB 695E Science Society and Ethics; SPH 649 Survival Skills and Ethics; or PHCL595B Scientific Writing Skills and Ethics. Although there is no specific requirement in the Genetics program for students to perform teaching assistantships; students are required to master the art of science communication. As part of satisfaction of this requirement, students must attend and participate in the graduate seminar course GENE 670 Advances in Genetics for a minimum of eight semesters. In this course, students learn to present their own work and the work of others to a broad audience of faculty and students on a regular basis. Students are also required to present in annual retreats of the Program. &amp;nbsp; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">SGD also offers a Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) minor in Geography for Ph.D. students majoring in other disciplines at UA. This program consists of a minimum of 12 units of graduate coursework in geography, including a maximum of 3 units of independent study. Students considering the Ph.D. minor in geography should consult with the Director of Graduate Studies and with potential SGD committee members at an early stage about coursework and preparation for the comprehensive examination. For more information about the Ph.D. minor in geography, see the graduate program handbook. The Doctorate of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Geography is a specialized, research-oriented degree which requires a qualifying examination (waived for students who meet certain minimum requirements), at least one year of coursework (minimum of 18 credits) in addition to a Masters degree, and approximately three years of independent study and research culminating in a dissertation. Under the direction of their faculty committee and in consultation with the graduate advisor, doctoral students design an individualized program of coursework and independent study in preparation for their comprehensive examinations, which are typically taken after two years of study. Upon successful completion of the exams, the student prepares a dissertation proposal which must be approved by the faculty committee. This proposal may also form the basis for requesting external funding for research. The final requirement for the Ph.D. degree is a dissertation involving original research. During students&amp;rsquo; time in the School, they will gain an understanding of the history and core concepts of the discipline, and range of&amp;nbsp; research methodologies.&amp;nbsp; They also have opportunities to obtain&amp;nbsp; teaching experience and&amp;nbsp; training in professional skills,. Potential applicants should be sure to review these webpages and our faculty interests before applying. While some faculty have research grants and may offer students both employment and research opportunities related to those projects, the majority of students design their own Ph.D dissertation topics and are encouraged to seek their own funding for field research and writing up the results. Our students have been remarkably successful at securing funding for their dissertations. </td>

By 2050, the region may double in population to nearly 40 million people with nearly 25 million jobs. Much of the existing built environment will be rebuilt. Given global climate change, limited water supply, problematic air sheds, fragile landscapes, and growth pressures, sustainable planning and development is an imperative &amp;ndash; more so in the Mountain West than perhaps any other region in the US. The Urban Planning Emphasis will help prepare the next generations of scholars and researchers for the interdisciplinary challenges of shaping urban areas and their regions to become sustainable and resilient.&amp;nbsp; With an Urban Planning Emphasis, Geography doctoral graduates will be competitive in urban planning academic programs, due to their rigorous training in the foundations of planning theory, practice and research. &amp;nbsp; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The requirements for completion of a minor in each of the five concentrations within the School. As noted above, students looking to complete a minor concentration outside of the SGPP should confirm the requirements for that minor with the host unit. Local unit rules and requirements always take precedence. The program offers expert faculty supervision and specialized course work in five concentrations. One of the priorities of SGPP is to cultivate and explore the various intersections between these all-too-often siloed subfields of our disciplines. Students are, accordingly, encouraged to explore these intersections in their course selection and research agendas. &amp;bull; American Politics. This concentration is home to expertise in political psychology, political participation, public opinion and voting behavior, public law and judicial process, congress and legislative process, political decision-making, political parties, state politics, and gender and politics. &amp;bull; Comparative Politics. This concentration is home to expertise in political economy and development, political institutions and elites, democratic theory, public opinion and voting behavior, communist and post-communist systems, Western Europe, Latin America, Middle East, East and South East Asia. &amp;bull; International Relations. This concentration is home to expertise in international conflict and conflict management, civil conflict and terrorism, international structures and integration, international theory, international political economy, and comparative foreign policy. &amp;bull; Public Policy &amp;amp; Management. This concentration is home to expertise in the public policy process, network theory and science, organizational theory, environment and sustainability, collaborative governance, crime and public policy, and public and non-profit management. &amp;bull; Research Methodology. This concentration is home to expertise in econometric methods, measurement, survey methodology, and other formal, quantitative, and qualitative techniques, including experimental methods, network science, geographic informations systems, fieldwork, and agent-based modeling. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Requirements for minor: Public Policy &amp;amp; Management (PPM)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; POL600 + POL601 + POL602 + 1 additional course from POL603&amp;mdash;619 + comprehensive exam &amp;nbsp; American Politics (AP)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; POL620 + 3 courses from POL621&amp;mdash;639 + comprehensive exam &amp;nbsp; Comparative Politics (CP)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; POL640 + 3 courses from POL641&amp;mdash;659 + comprehensive exam &amp;nbsp; International Relations (IR)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; POL660 + courses from POL661&amp;mdash;679 + comprehensive exam Research Methodology (RM)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; POL680 + POL681 + POL682 + POL683 + 2 courses from POL684&amp;mdash;689 + comprehensive exam &amp;nbsp; </td>

Upon completion of the certificate program, students will have knowledge and skills in the following areas: strategic planning, budgeting and finance, health care economics and policy, and advanced health care services administration. The certificate is comprised of five courses (for a total of 15 credits) and courses are offered to students on both the Tucson and Phoenix MEZCOPH campuses (NOTE: with the exception of one course, in-person attendance is required for students, so this is not an online or correspondence program). The time needed to complete the certificate requirements largely depends on a student&amp;rsquo;s existing commitments at entry to the program and especially the support the student has from his/her supervisor or employer to participate in the program. Students are strongly encouraged to secure sufficient support to complete the program within one to two years. Upon completion of the certificate, all five courses will be allowed to transfer to the Master of Public Health degree program if the student is admitted to the MPH program and the courses meet degree requirements. &amp;nbsp; </td>

The doctoral degree program in Health Behavior Health Promotion&amp;nbsp;has an emphasis on the biological, behavioral, and socio-cultural determinants of health and health behavior, as well as the interventions and policies aimed at improving community and population health.&amp;nbsp; The doctoral program offers a diverse and challenging curriculum addressing health behavior health promotion theory, knowledge and skills for working on health issues within the diverse communities of the Southwestern United States. Outstanding course performance and strong evidence for research interest and aptitude in health behavior health promotion is required for all admitted students.&amp;nbsp; A bachelor&amp;#39;s degree is required for entry into the PhD program.&amp;nbsp; However, applicants without a prior related master&amp;rsquo;s degree will complete a Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) in route to their PhD in Health Behavior Health Promotion. The MSPH develops the student&amp;#39;s ability to think critically, develop and execute research, while also providing depth in health behavior health promotion, epidemiology and biostatistics, essential skills of a future PhD student and health promotion health behavior scholar. The MSPH is not a stand-alone degree; students interested in graduate studies in HBHP who are uncertain of a research career focus are encouraged to discuss applying for the Master of Public Health (MPH) with department faculty and MEZCOPH&amp;rsquo;s Office of Student Services and Alumni&amp;nbsp;Affairs. The MPH with a concentration in HBHP affords sound preparation for the PhD program while foremost being designed as a functional terminal degree for immediate workforce entry. The doctoral program requires approximately four to five years for completion. The first two years of this time are usually devoted to coursework, the comprehensive doctoral examinations, and development of doctoral research. The program is research oriented and centers on a major research project. For Students Entering with a Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree: The PhD curriculum requires a minimum of 63 credit hours (units). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of this, 18 units are required from major courses; 3 units are required on US minority/health disparities; 3 units on health promotion research content electives;&amp;nbsp; 12 units of other electives; 9 units (minimum) for the minor; and 18 units for the dissertation. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A maximum of 30 units from a prior degree may be applied towards an admitted student, pending review by the student&amp;rsquo;s advisory committee.

Established in 1977, the Center for the Study of Higher Education offers flexible, interdisciplinary, and individualized master of arts and doctor of philosophy degree programs with concentrations in comparative higher education, organization and administration, college access, and student affairs. The Center&amp;#39;s Faculty Dr. Nolan Cabrera, Assistant Professor Dr. Regina Deil-Amen, Associate Professor Dr. Mary Irwin, Assistant Professor of Practice, Director Project SOAR Dr. Amanda Kraus, Assistant Professor of Practice Dr. Jenny Lee, Associate Professor Dr. Jameson Lopez, Assitant Professor Dr. Gary Rhoades, Professor and Center Director Dr. Karina Salazar, Assistant Professor The Center&amp;#39;s work is distinguished by: A commitment not just to improving practice, but also to educational changes that enhance the realization of social justice in higher education. A consideration of how developments in the political economy shape and are expressed in the restructuring of higher education settings, professions, and practices. An exploration of the international/global dimensions, issues, and agencies related to higher education, with particular attention devoted to the Americas. These distinctive characteristics go beyond individual faculty; they reflect a collective synergy and orientation of our faculty to scholarship and practice. A Diverse, Supportive, Challenging Intellectual Community Each year we admit around ten (10) Ph.D. students and twenty (20) M.A. students. The life experience and perspectives of the 90-100 students enrolled here flavor our program. A high proportion of our students are accomplished professionals and we value the practical experience and organizational skills they bring. Ours is a diverse, supportive, challenging intellectual community. Over half of our students are women, over 20 percent are students of color, and over 10 percent are international students. Many are first generation students. This diversity enriches our community and work. In recognition for its commitment to diversity and inclusiveness, the Center for the Study of Higher Ed has been honored with the Peter W. Likins Inclusive Excellence Award in 2010. Faculty at the Center help foster a culture of research We are supportive of each others&amp;#39; work and that of our students. Most of our students work, yet are fully engaged intellectually in a program that emphasizes a culture of research and reflective practice. Our aim is to bring theories and findings from the academic literature to bear on professional practice in ways that enhance students&amp;#39; abilities to understand, analyze, and act within postsecondary organizations and systems. We seek students who are deeply committed to the advancement and improvement of higher education as students, practitioners, scholars, and activists. Most of our students advance into positions in various support professions and administration, but some also pursue faculty positions. Although most obtain positions on college and university campuses, we have also placed students in systemwide administration, policy agencies such as WICHE, and in private enterprise. An important contributor to our intellectual community is the Higher Education Student Organization (HESO). It sponsors formal and informal annual functions and activities that are academic, professional, and social in nature and that address student needs as well as bring students and faculty together for supportive exchange. </td>

The minor may be formal or informal. A formal minor will appear on the final transcript and diploma. An informal minor fulfills the Higher Education program requirements for the degree but does NOT appear on the diploma. However, the informal minor does indicate the specific sub area of expertise the student has acquired. If pursuing a formal minor, the student should consult with the department offering that minor to make sure the student fulfills all minor requirements for that minor. If pursuing an informal minor, agreement simply needs to be made between the student and advisor on the appropriate classes, which can all be outside the Higher Education program or split between Higher Ed and the other department. </td>

An important contributor to our intellectual community is the&amp;nbsp;Higher Education Student Organization (HESO). It sponsors formal and informal annual functions and activities that are academic, professional, and social in nature and that address student needs as well as bring students and faculty together for supportive exchange. The doctoral program integrates core courses in Higher Education, electives, and a minor in individually tailored courses of study that encourage students to undertake course-work with faculty in a variety of departments. The substantive core coursework (Higher Education in the U.S.,, Organization and Administration, and either College Access and Success, Theories of Inequality, Oppression, and Social Stratification, or Introduction to Comparative Higher Education) provides a foundation enabling students to comprehend the central socio-political, cultural, organizational, and economic structures comprising and influencing American higher education. The core methods classes (Quantitative Methods in Higher Education. Qualitative Methods in Higher Education, and Research Design) provide students with foundational skills with which to frame their dissertation research and other forms of inquiry, The aim within each is for students to acquire a comprehensive understanding of concepts, theoretical frameworks, issues and practices in a particular area. Such work is organized to provide a solid foundation for students&amp;#39; doctoral dissertations as well as for their particular field of professional work. In addition to the concentration, doctoral students pursue a minor. The minor may be in higher education, in some other field (e.g. the student&amp;#39;s area of master&amp;#39;s work) or split between higher education and some other department. Departments/Academic Unit(s) Educational Policy Studies and Practice - https://www.coe.arizona.edu/epsp The Department of Educational Policy Studies and Practice (EPSP) includes the Educational Leadership Program and the Center for the Study of Higher Education. The EPSP department combines the K-12 focus with postsecondary education to create a P-20 perspective that taps into the dominant discourse of education and policymakers today. Both the Center for the Study of Higher Education (HED) and the Educational Leadership (EDL) program maintain their core functions and curriculum, consistent with professional career paths and state standards for certification leading to licensure. However, the combined unit more broadly facilitates and encourages research, instructional, and service and outreach initiatives consistent with a policy development and analysis focus. A&amp;nbsp; key departmental strength concentrates on how organizations, institutions (both formal and informal), official practices, and educational professions affect outcomes across local, national, and international contexts and how these entities are themselves affected by societal, economic, and political pressures. EPSP prepares graduate students at the doctorate and master&amp;#39;s levels. Graduate programs in HED include Ph.D. and M.A. degrees. Graduate programs in EDL include an Ed.D., Ph.D., Ed.S., and M.Ed. The M.Ed. degree is a standards-driven curriculum leading to both a degree and state certification for the principalship.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">What is HLT? Human Language Technology is a developing interdisciplinary field that encompasses most subdisciplines of linguistics, as well as computational linguistics, natural language processing, computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics. Anywhere language comes in contact with information technology, or where humans need to interact with computers, language needs to be organized so that it can be handled and processed by computational means. This often requires broad knowledge not only about linguistics and how languages work, but also about computer science and related fields. Well-known topics in human language technology include web search engine technology (an instance of information retrieval), speech recognition (computer dictation), speech synthesis (computer-generated speech), optical character recognition (OCR), machine translation, electronic dictionaries, spell checking, grammar checking, word processing, computer typesetting, computer-assisted language teaching, automatic captioning on TV - in short, any and all tasks where human language and information technology meet. For a more in-depth perspective of the field, see the first chapter of Dan Jurafsky&amp;#39;s and James Martin&amp;#39;s book, Speech and Language Processing, which is available online and provides a good overview of the field. What do studies include? At the University of Arizona, our objective is to provide a balanced curriculum in linguistics, computational linguistics, and practical skills like business training. Upon completion of the program, students will have the skills required to enter a competitive workforce. We also work closely with providers of internship opportunities in the industry to assure that students receive strong hands-on experience in the form of a final project, preferably done in the industry. The minimum number of credits to be completed is 36, and students will also write a Master&amp;#39;s thesis documenting an actual completed implementation. Possible local industrial internship opportunities include Lockheed Martin (Phoenix), Intel (Chandler), Raytheon (Tucson), and Motorola (Phoenix). What kinds of jobs require knowledge of HLT? Many jobs are centered in the IT-industry where a variety of companies are in need of trained HLT professionals. But the wide coverage of the field also guarantees a wide choice of careers, some of them closer to language-related work, some closer to computer science. Human Language Technology represents the fastest growing field of language research. Because of its industrial applications, it provides far more employment opportunities than are available in traditional academic research. The Master of Science degree in HLT is designed for students who are interested in going directly into industry rather than going into academia on the PhD track. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Human Language Technology is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, linguistics and psychology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; HLT is an emerging field of application for linguistic technology given the explosive growth of the (multilingual) internet, from search tools to large datasets in many specialized domains. The Accelerated HLT Master&amp;#39;s Program targets advanced undergraduate students with background in programming and mathematical methods who wish to pursue a masters degree in HLT during and directly after their BA degree. Students are trained by faculty who bridge both sides of the formal linguistics and language engineering equation, and usually complete their MS in Human Language Technology one year after graduating with their BA degree. The goal of this program is to train students for HLT-related jobs in industry both in Arizona and nationwide, and more generally, to promote computational methods as skills that linguistics students will find increasingly useful in this computerized and modern world. </td>

In the proposed program students can explore such critical issues as: data rights, privacy, misinformation, artificial intelligence, surveillance, cyberactivism, encryption, e-learning, and data literacy.&amp;nbsp; Numerous technologies will also be covered such as big databases, blockchain, surveillance technology, virtual reality, crowdsourcing of human rights data, and archiving of digital media. &amp;nbsp;These technologies have the potential to significantly advance human rights, but technology is also being used to surveil, harass, disrupt, and suppress individuals and groups seeking to advance human rights.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This program will critically assess the capabilities and limitations of currently used and emerging ICTs. Students will take one required course in HRTS and one in the I-School.&amp;nbsp; They will also take two electives and complete an&amp;nbsp;experiential course called Human Rights and Technology Project.&amp;nbsp; It is expected that their project will be applied and bring important insights gained from both human rights and technology.&amp;nbsp; With the innovative curriculum and pedagogy of the HRTS program that relies heavily on videoconference guest lectures, students will learn from human rights practitioners and technological experts who are breaking new ground using technological applications for advancing human rights. Students will also have opportunity to work with scholars who study the ethical and political dimensions of technology and human rights, and the implications of new challenges like fake news, false video, data collection and improper use.&amp;nbsp; Through their coursework and final projects students will have the opportunity to work on real-world projects with human rights organizations and technology professionals.&amp;nbsp; Please visit&amp;nbsp;https://humanrightspractice.arizona.edu&amp;nbsp;for comprehensive information about this program. </td>

Thesis option students are expected to acquire basic computer programming and coding skills, although these undergraduate units are not included in the Master&amp;#39;s Plan of Study. All M.S. students must complete a field methods-field synthesis course sequence: HWRS 513 A (Spring) and HWRS 513B (Summer Presession) for a total of 3 units. To meet the professional development requirement, M.S. Thesis option students are required to enroll in the HAS department&amp;#39;s weekly seminar-colloquium, HWRS 595A (1 unit), for at least one semester during academic residency. These units are not included in the Master&amp;#39;s Plan of Study. Each M.S. Thesis option student must complete fundamental (core) courses in hydrology and water resources unless equivalent graduate courses have been taken elsewhere. Consult with the Director of Graduate Studies-Hydrology regarding potential graduate transfer course work for the Master&amp;#39;s degree. For the M.S. Thesis option, a research-based Master&amp;#39;s Thesis is required. A Master&amp;rsquo;s Final Oral Examination is required.

Learn more about our research focus areas here. The program is designed for students with interests in the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of the hydrologic cycle, as well as water resources systems, environmental studies, or water policy and the social sciences related to water resources. Students may concentrate in one or a combination of these fields but should acquire fundamental proficiency in all aspects of hydrology and water resources. Research-based doctoral study programs are individually planned to meet the student&amp;#39;s special interests and professional objectives. Doctoral applicants should have completed a Master of Science degree with a major in hydrology, water resources, environmental sciences, environmental engineering, or a related field. (Holders of a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree cannot enter the Ph.D. program directly.) All doctoral students are expected to have or acquire capability for basic coding/computer programming (e.g., Python, MATLAB, Fortran, C++). Students must also complete a field methods-field synthesis course sequence (begins in the spring semester and ends in the presession summer session). Students develop professional communication skills through enrollment in the department&amp;#39;s weekly colloquium (weekly seminar series), typically during the first year of academic residency, and by making two formal presentations (minimum one oral presentation) of their own dissertation research at approved regional or national conferences near the end of their academic residency. Doctoral students may complete fundamental core courses in hydrology and water resources, but no specific core courses are required. Inclusion of core coursework in the Doctoral Plan of Study is dependent on a student&amp;#39;s educational and professional experience. Where gaps exist in background knowledge of relevant subject matter, a student may be required to take fundamental coursework during their first year in academic residence and prior to the Doctoral Oral Qualifying Examination (details below). After all coursework has been completed, a Comprehensive Examination process (written and oral components) is begun, typically by the end of the third year in residence. A research-based Doctoral Dissertation manuscript is required; the Doctoral Dissertation Publication format option is also available. A Doctoral Final Oral Examination, or defense of the dissertation, is required at the end of residency. More information is available at the department&amp;#39;s website, Doctor of Philosophy in HWRS. Students with a Ph.D. degree in Hydrology have multiple career paths and enjoy professional careers in private industry, government and tribal agencies, NGOs and NPOs, and academia and national laboratories.

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Arizona now offer the nation&amp;rsquo;s first graduate degree programs (MS, PhD) with a Major in Hydrometeorology. Faculty members in a variety of focus areas advise students, provide research opportunities, and teach courses for these degree programs. Refer to the list of Core Faculty and list of Focus Areas below for potential advisors. Core Faculty:&amp;nbsp; http://has.arizona.edu/people/core-faculty Focus Areas in Terrestrial Hydrometeorology: http://has.arizona.edu/research-focus-areas#FocusTerr Background The terrestrial water cycle includes the atmospheric component (water vapor, clouds, and precipitation) and the land component (surface and subsurface runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, snowmelt, river flow). Hydrometeorology plays a major role in weather and climate and strongly affects human activities. Historically, the science and practice of hydrology has focused on land-related processes and has relied on prescribed atmospheric inputs (from observations or atmospheric model outputs, or through empirical estimates derived from conventional meteorological measurements). In other words, the land-generated feedbacks to the atmosphere have usually not been considered. In contrast, while the atmospheric sciences generate hydrologically-relevant forecasts, they tend to avoid dealing with the details of processes influencing feedbacks generated by the land surface. Nature and Purpose of Program The Major in Hydrometeorology provides the linkage of hydrology and atmospheric science. In establishing this linkage, it addresses the following questions: What is the science involved with the interface of water in the atmosphere and water on the ground? What are the ramifications for predictive capabilities when these processes are incorporated into coupled numerical weather and climate models? What are the new applications in water quality (and how are water quality issues linked to precipitation and related run off issues)? How is the full understanding of the hydrologic cycle from &amp;quot;white water&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;blue water&amp;quot; (from precipitation to streams to ocean to water vapor to precipitation) related to the advancements in prediction and related societal benefits that link back to the water quality issue? The purpose of the UA Hydrometeorology Program is to become the first and premier Hydrometeorology program in the World. Our mission is to: Educate students by providing them with (1) a well-rounded background in the related fields of atmospheric, hydrologic and systems sciences, (2) the tools and methods for numerical modeling, prediction and data assimilation (surface hydrology, weather and climate), and (3) the sensors, data sources and data manipulation tools, including remote-sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) Partner with various national and international weather and climate forecasting agencies to identify critical hydrometeorological knowledge gaps, to support, encourage, and facilitate research in multidisciplinary hydrometeorological science, and to work towards improved forecasts and forecast support (particularly over arid and semiarid regions, such as the Western US), and Serve the hydrometeorological science and operational communities by coordinating meetings and workshops seeking to build consensus related to hydrometeorological science and to assist in the transfer of advances in understanding into the decision-making arena. </td>

Students interested in NAMA can either be speakers or second language learners of their language, or ones who have studied a particular Native American language and have close contact with that language community. The specialized nature of this degree focuses on indigenous languages and meeting the needs of Native American communities: due to the rapid decline in the use of heritage languages tribal communities have pressed for practical linguistic training to: revitalize, maintain, and document indigenous languages; provide skills and expertise for Native American linguists to develop teaching grammars and other educational materials; promote understanding of indigenous peoples&amp;#39; educational issues at every level of policy making; enhance and promote understanding of complex factors leading to language choice, language shift and language loss, and; work with archival media (such as audio legacy audio recordings and historical documents) to enrich the language record and to produce viable teaching materials We are also open to other community-oriented objectives and projects. Additionally, NAMA students are encouraged to participate in the life of the Linguistics Department and other university departments (Anthropology, American Indian Studies). There are many opportunities to enrich their experiences and professional network through interacting with other students, professors and researchers who have similar goals and interests &amp;ndash; there is a wealth of knowledge and experience to draw upon. Students complete the degree in one academic year plus one summer doing coursework at the American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI). The NAMA program also often serves a stepping stone for those students who wish to advance to the Ph.D. level in linguistics or related disciplines. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">These are the requirements for a doctoral minor for students from other departments:&amp;nbsp; PhD students at the University of Arizona who are not in the Management and Organizations (M&amp;amp;O) program, but wish to minor in M&amp;amp;O, must take 3 complete PhD courses that are not Master&amp;rsquo;s level courses (i.e., courses in the MBA program or master&amp;rsquo;s programs cannot be used as part of the minor requirement). Additionally, you&amp;nbsp;will also&amp;nbsp;have to take a methods course in our department prior to enrolling (this is in addition to the&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;PhD courses). Finally, a M&amp;amp;O PhD minor requires the completion of a comprehensive style exam or a research paper, both of which are chaired by a tenure-track faculty member of the M&amp;amp;O department. Importantly, this faculty advisor must be identified before any coursework begins to ensure that the student has the support of a faculty member in the department. Approval to begin the M&amp;amp;O minor must be obtained from the M&amp;amp;O PhD program directors after the minor advisor has been selected.&amp;nbsp; Please note that the structure of courses in the M&amp;amp;O department varies from most departments on campus, in that one &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; PhD course involves taking a sequence of 8-week courses offered back-to-back within the same semester. For example, students taking Human Resources Management would sign up for MGMT 621 (Human Resources Management I) and MGMT 622 (Human Resources Management II), both of which are worth 2.0 credit hours. This means that a &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; course in our program that would count towards the M&amp;amp;O minor is worth 4.0 credit hours, versus the 3.0 credit&amp;nbsp;hours of other 16-week courses.&amp;nbsp; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">What is the Accelerated Master&amp;rsquo;s Program? The Graduate College offers exceptional undergraduate Marketing students the opportunity to earn both a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree and master&amp;rsquo;s degree in as few as 5 years. Student will start taking graduate level courses during their senior year at Eller and those graduate courses will count for both their undergraduate degree and their graduate degree at the cost of undergraduate tuition! The primary goal of the program is to provide students with a comprehensive foundation of the principles and practices of marketing and its role in developing and implementing successful business and marketing strategies.&amp;nbsp; The marketing-focused curriculum, offered by renowned and world-class Marketing Department Faculty, provides students with both conceptual frameworks as well as analytical tools to formulate and identify business and marketing problems and opportunities, understand customers and incorporate customer insights to make informed marketing decisions, and design effective marketing plans to improve business performance.&amp;nbsp; Students graduating from the program are expected to have deep conceptual and analytical skills valued in a wide variety of industry sectors, both nationally and internationally.&amp;nbsp; Recent graduates have obtained placements in companies such as Accenture, Amazon, Disney, Hexagon Mining, Magna International, NBCUniversal, Raytheon, Sunquest, Uhaul, Target and Wal-Mart.&amp;nbsp; The program also kindled an interest in some outstanding students to pursue doctoral education and an academic career in Marketing.&amp;nbsp; Thus some recent graduates have also joined the PhD Program in Marketing at The University of Arizona and at the University of Texas at Dallas. Required courses include: Market-Based Management Business Statistics Managerial and Financial Accounting Marketing Research and Analytics Marketing Strategy.&amp;nbsp; In addition, students choose from a wide array of elective courses: Brand Management Digital Marketing Management of Marketing Communications Visual Analytics with Tableau and Data Mining Innovation and Product Strategy Pricing and Channel Strategy International Marketing. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Students in other PhD programs may earn a PhD minor in Mathematics by completing 12 units of approved graduate course work in mathematics.&amp;nbsp; All the course work must be approved by the Mathematics PhD minor advisor before students begin their course work. To apply for the minor, students must fill out the online form and have it approved before the advisor will approve the Plan of Study form in GradPath, or serve on the Oral Comprehensive Exam committee. Students must earn a &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; or higher in all coursework, or receive instructor approval that indicates the student&amp;#39;s performance in their course merits a PhD minor. If a student does not receive a &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; or higher, and the instructor does not feel the student&amp;rsquo;s performance merits a PhD minor, the student may appeal the decision. The appeals process is outlined below. All transfer course work must be approved by the minor advisor, with final approval given by the Director of Graduate Studies. In cases where suitable course work was transferred or where the advisor cannot or will not approve the transfer credit, an examination set by the PhD minor advisor may be substituted. The student may also appeal the decision as outlined below. Students may also choose two supporting minor subjects, in which case 6 units of approved graduate course work is required for each minor. Mathematics courses that are required for the student&amp;#39;s PhD major or are in the subject area of the student&amp;#39;s PhD major may not be used towards the Mathematics PhD minor. (For example, a PhD student in Statistics cannot use math courses that are required for the Statistics PhD or math courses whose content is statistics for the Mathematics PhD minor.) Some co-convened courses may be suitable as part of the PhD minor, but as a general rule the PhD minor advisor will not approve a plan of study that includes more than 6 units of co-convened courses.&amp;nbsp; It is highly recommended that students consult with their PhD minor advisor about the suitability of their course work for the minor and for their careers before beginning their coursework. The PhD minor advisor is currently Professor David Glickenstein. Appeals Procedure If a student wishes to appeal any of the requirements mentioned above, the appeal should be made in writing to the Director of Graduate Studies. The appeal will be reviewed by the Graduate Committee and requires a majority vote to succeed. The Committee may place additional requirements/deadlines on the student as a prerequisite for continuing in the program. Students who wish to appeal the decision of the Graduate Committee must submit an appeal in writing to Head of the Mathematics Department, who will make a decision in consultation with other faculty, as appropriate. </td>

Applicants are asked to submit scores on the Graduate Record Examination, including the subject Examination in Mathematics. For the Doctor of Philosophy degree, the requirements are: 36 units of graduate credit in the major and 12 units in a supporting minor, which may be declared in Mathematics, although outside minors are encouraged. Students will normally either take the first year graduate core courses in Algebra (Math 511A-B), Real Analysis (Math 523A-B), and Geometry-Topology (Math 534A-B), or otherwise learn this material by the end of their first year of Ph.D. studies for the Qualifying Examinations. Qualifying examinations are offered twice yearly, in August and in January, shortly before the beginning of Fall and Spring semesters. Students with prior preparation may attempt the examinations upon entrance to the program, or after one semester. Ideally a student will complete the qualifying examinations by the August following entrance to the Ph.D. program. Students who receive a failing grade twice on any one of the examinations will not be continued in the Ph.D. program. Students who do not complete the three examinations within five semesters and with a cumulative passing grade will not be continued in the Ph.D. program unless the Graduate Committee, upon review of the case, finds extenuating reasons to justify such continuation. Two year-long Mathematics course sequences that are not co-convened and are not part of the required core of algebra, real analysis, and geometry-topology are required. These two sequences must be in two of the three general areas: algebra and number theory, analysis and geometry, mathematical physics and applied mathematics. For most students one of the sequences will be Complex Analysis (Math 520A-B). At least six approved units outside of Mathematics are also required. There is a language requirement which can be satisfied in any two of the following: French, German, Russian, or computer programming. The principal component of the program is the completion of a dissertation involving original creative research. Ph.D. candidates with other majors who wish to minor in Mathematics are required to take four approved graduate level courses in mathematics and a written examination which covers the content of those courses. </td>

Founded in 2007, this program is CAMPEP accredited. Students who choose this program will be involved in course work covering radiation physics, imaging physics, radiation oncology physics, radiation safety, radiation biology and business.&amp;nbsp; Students will also have the opportunity to participate in a clinical radiation oncology physics internship. This internship will provide extensive training in radiation oncology physics including linear accelerator calibration, treatment planning, quality assurance, chart checking, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and imaging.&amp;nbsp; Imaging internships may be arranged for interested students. Students who complete this track will be well prepared for part 1 of the American Board of Radiology certification exam and will be ready to enter a medical physics residency program. Research is an essential part of this program. Each student will be involved in a research project over the course of the time in the program.&amp;nbsp; Student research projects are generally clinical in nature but opportunities for basic science projects are possible. The PSM-Medical Physics program also requires at least one business course as part of the program. Professional medical physicists are often involved in the business side of medicine and our program provides preparation for these duties. Graduating students will be able to adapt the business side of medical physics and provide knowledgeable contributions to their employers. </td>

Many teachers and administrators have rich understandings of teaching strategy and content, but have had little opportunity to explore theoretical or conceptual knowledge of how students learn. In this certificate program, students have the opportunity to study rich concepts and theories that have been developed in the fields of motivation, instruction, and learning. Further, students will have the opportunity to study important issues in educational policy. These opportunities will explore past and modern conceptions of school reform. Better understanding of how (and why) students learn in classrooms can lead to more focused and more effective instruction. Further, better understanding of student motivation in the social classroom environment can allow for the better design of classroom learning environments and help to determine when different instructional choices (individual, tutorial, small group or whole class) might be most useful. Studying educational policy and reform can help students to understand the issues of reform in terms of research and evidence rather than in terms of advocacy and &amp;quot;crises.&amp;quot; </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Doctoral degrees are awarded to candidates who display deep understanding of the subject matter of their disciplines as well as the ability to make original contributions to knowledge in their fields. The University of Arizona FFSOM offers the Doctor of Musical Arts degree with concentrations in the fields of Composition, Conducting, and Performance, and the Doctor of Philosophy degree with concentrations in Music Education, &amp;nbsp;Music Theory, or Musicology. The FFSOM does not permit double use of courses in a major and a minor or in a second minor. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Core Academic Courses for DMA Degrees Composition, Conducting, and students in Voice, Piano/Keyboard, and Instrumental Performance must select fifteen units of course work from the following three categories of core courses: Category A--Music Education (min. 3 units): 550, 551, 603, 604, 650, 654, 655, 672, 696a Category B--Music Theory (min. 3 units): 520A, 520B, 521A, 521B, 521C, 534, 541 OR 542, 622, 623, 624A, 624B, 625A, 625B, 696c Category C--Historical Musicology and Ethnomusicology (min. 3 units): 530, 531, 532, 533, 535, 536, 568, 595b, 596b, 696b, 696f Ensemble Policy for DMA Degrees Doctoral degrees may require large conducted ensemble participation as delineated in each degree grid. Applied music registration (MUSI) requires concurrent enrollment in the appropriate large conducted ensemble (MUS 500). The appropriate large conducted ensemble varies by degree plan. The required large conducted ensemble must be chosen from the following list, designed to support applied and academic study in each degree plan: Bowed Strings: MUS 500O (Section 1), Arizona Symphony Voice: MUS 500L Arizona Choir Wind/Percussion: MUS 500D, E, O, or R Piano/Keyboard, Harp, Guitar:&amp;nbsp; MUS 500 or 501 or 502 An audition process designed and administered by the ensemble directors in consultation with the applied faculty and approved by the Director of the FFSOM will determine participation in the appropriate large conducted ensemble. Students whose degree grids specify a large conducted ensemble requirement of two or more credits must participate in a large conducted ensemble in a two-semester sequence.&amp;nbsp; For course and program requirements for specific DMA&amp;nbsp;degrees in music, please see The Graduate Handbook </td>

Ecology, Management and Restoration of Rangelandst: Students may specialize in any of several areas, usually related to ongoing research projects and faculty expertise. These areas of specialization include plant-herbivore interactions, fire ecology, rangeland policy, soil-vegetation interactions, global change, long-term vegetation dynamics, and human dimensions of rangeland management. &amp;nbsp; Natural Resources Studies: The Natural Resources Studies emphasis is intended to provide an interdisciplinary graduate education for individuals who wish to contribute to natural resource policy and management decisions made in an environment increasingly influenced not only by technical elements, but by economic, legal, political, and social factors. This option is appropriate for students continuing from undergraduate work in natural resource management and for mid-career professionals interested in broadening their expertise in natural resource policy, administration, planning, management, and ecology.&amp;nbsp; Course requirements for the option in Natural Resources Studies are higher than for the other programs. Contact the graduate coordinator for additional information. &amp;nbsp; Watershed Management and Ecohydrology: The emphasis of the Watershed Program is on interactions between hydrologic processes and land-surface conditions and the application of this knowledge to land-water resource planning and management. The focus of the program is on arid/semiarid regions of the southwestern United States and the world. Research areas include hydrology, hydrologic-vegetative interactions, soil-water processes, erosion and sedimentation, stream dynamics, watershed modeling, hydrologic effects of management, land-use, and climate change. Other research areas include analysis and assessment (including GIS), economics and policy, integrated watershed management, fire effects, and tree ring studies. Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation and Management: Students may emphasize in Wildlife Conservation and Management or Fisheries Conservation and Management. Graduate studies are designed to provide training in ecological principles, field research techniques, and the application of these tools for the management and conservation of all types of wildlife and fisheries resources. The program responds to the research needs of the State of Arizona, the Southwest region of the United States, the United States, and international governments and organizations. The Arizona Game and Fish Department, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Forest Service frequently assist in the development and support of research projects. Within the School, the U.S. Geological Survey also maintains the Arizona Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and the Sonoran Desert Field Station. Graduate degrees qualify students for professional careers with state agencies, such as state game and fish departments; federal agencies, such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; colleges and universities; conservation organizations; private industry; and consulting firms.

Students pursuing the M.S. or Ph.D. degree may elect one of four disciplinary emphasis areas: Ecology, Management, and Restortation of Rangelands; Natural Resources Studies; Watershed Management and Ecohydrology; and Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation and Management.&amp;nbsp; Students also may choose from a wide variety of minor subjects, including soil science, watershed management, animal science, wildlife ecology, plant science, ecology, anthropology, public administration, and global change. Career opportunities for M.S. and Ph.D. graduates exist in federal and state natural resource agencies and legislative policy and budget offices; in non-governmental organizations; in offices of corporations and trade associations concerned with natural resource policy and administration; and in international development agencies, consulting firms, universities, and private research organizations. Students working toward the M.S. degree, thesis track, shall complete a minimum of 30 units including a thesis for which as many as 6 units may be earned.&amp;nbsp; Students working towards the M.S. degree, non-thesis track, shall complete a minimum of 36 units. The Ph.D. requires a minimum of 63 units distributed as follows: 36 units in the major, 9 units from the minor, and 18 units of dissertation.&amp;nbsp; For information concerning requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees see Requirements for Master&amp;#39;s Degrees and Requirements for Doctoral Degrees (https://grad.arizona.edu/gsas/degree-requirements). Applicants for the Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degree programs are required to submit 1) a well-crafted letter of intent, 2) three letters of recommendation, 3) a summary of coursework (available through the School), and 4) a resume. Additionally, applicants are strongly encouraged to communicate with prospective faculty advisors prior to applying. Applicants are expected to have completed an undergraduate major in a natural resources or closely related field with strong training in biological, physical, and social sciences comparable to that required for the bachelor&amp;#39;s degree at The University of Arizona. Applicants lacking these prerequisites will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Watershed Management and Ecohydrology: The emphasis of the Watershed Program is on interactions between hydrologic processes and land-surface conditions and the application of this knowledge to land-water resource planning and management. The focus of the program is on arid/semiarid regions of the southwestern United States and the world. Research areas include hydrology, hydrologic-vegetative interactions, soil-water processes, erosion and sedimentation, stream dynamics, watershed modeling, hydrologic effects of management, land-use, and climate change. Other research areas include analysis and assessment (including GIS), economics and policy, integrated watershed management, fire effects, and tree ring studies. &amp;nbsp; </td>

A number of employers in the optics industry seek students with M.S. degrees in optics from the Wyant College of Optical Sciences. The AMP degree does such in one additional year by using the already extensive optics knowledge students have obtained as a B.S. OSE student. It provides outstanding students with additional training and experience for extended job opportunities, potential leadership positions upon graduation, experience in advanced laboratories, and opportunities in state-of-the-art research.&amp;nbsp; </td>

Its graduates become engineers, designers and technical managers. They work in hardware design, medical and biomedical technology, lasers and electro-optical systems, fiber optics and communications, measurements, manufacturing, and consumer technology. They work for large corporations, small companies, government agencies, universities, hospitals and research centers. Many even work for themselves, having started successful businesses or gone into consulting. The M.S. in Optical Sciences has no core curriculum, allowing the program considerable flexibility. A student may limit coursework to a single topic area, or he or she may instead form the nucleus of the master&amp;#39;s degree around the core courses for the&amp;nbsp;Ph.D. in Optical Sciences&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; none of which are required. Students may also choose between a&amp;nbsp;thesis option&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;nonthesis option&amp;nbsp;(see&amp;nbsp;requirements).

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">Our Ph.D. program is designed to put students in direct contact with the topics and questions that are at the forefront of contemporary physics research. Never satisfied with traditional ways of approaching problems and inspired by a strong interdisciplinary vision, we believe in pushing the envelope in research and teaching. We stand out by offering students research opportunities as part of the curriculum, immediately upon entering our program. Our doctoral program is flexible, designed to accommodate a broad range of interests and backgrounds. Many of our entering students find that their interests change while they&amp;#39;re here, but our diverse research areas and degree options allow graduate students the versatility to do their best work, regardless of where their investigations lead them. If you&amp;#39;re ambitious and motivated, you&amp;#39;ll find that our Ph.D. program will challenge you to reach your highest level of achievement.&amp;nbsp; Just as collaboration and flexibility are strengths of our graduate program in Physics, the breadth of our curriculum is another. The Physics Department offers a wide variety of courses, fostering an unsurpassed environment for learning and discovery. In addition to the core graduate-level curriculum, we also offer breadth courses that introduce students to new topics, and specialty courses that bring students up-to-date on the current state of knowledge in their chosen fields. Early independent-study research projects are strongly encouraged to connect students with individual professors in their areas of study. Students who seek interdisciplinary research &amp;nbsp;may develop a minor specialization outside of physics, taking advantage of the richness of course offerings in other departments. Our program is flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of interests, yet rigorous enough to ensure the deepest levels of academic excellence and preparation. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The program accepts applicants for PhD only. There is no terminal Master of Arts Program although on route a Master of Arts degree is obtained for the doctorate. Our Department is part of the School of Mind, Brain, and Behavior (MBB), and is housed within the College of Science, in keeping with its strong research-oriented approach and scientifically-derived knowledge base. Psychology is by its very nature interdisciplinary, and its faculty and students interact and collaborate naturally with other MBB programs and departments&amp;mdash;Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and Speech, Language and Hearing Science&amp;mdash;as well as with other academic units across campus.&amp;nbsp; The Psychology Department offers an exciting array of courses and research experiences and also provides many opportunities for students to serve in the broader University and Tucson community. &amp;nbsp; Our graduate Ph.D. program provides concentrations of study in three distinct (although interacting) program areas: Clinical Psychology; Cognition and Neural Systems (CNS); and Social Psychology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These graduate programs vary in specific contents and research methods, but all share basic goals that are compatible with our philosophy of training and the mission of our University as a Research I institution. The department offers programs designed for students seeking completion of the Doctor of Philosophy degree with a major in psychology. Concentrations are available in Clinical Psychology (clinical neuropsychology, psychopathology and affective disorders, family and health psychology); Cognition and Neural Systems (neurobiology of learning, memory and aging, cognitive and computational neuroscience, neurophysiology, cognitive psychology, including emphases in perception, memory, psycholinguistics, decision making, problem solving and cognitive development, cognitive neuropsychology, consciousness studies, environmental cognition, and knowledge representation)&amp;nbsp;and Social Psychology (the self, motivation, culture, personality, social cognition, prejudice and stereotyping, racial, ethnic, and gender identity, attitudes and persuasion, health and coping). Our faculty members are engaged in leading edge research in a large number of areas, as indicated by the volume and impact of their publications and their prominence in other ways.&amp;nbsp; Our research activities are fully integrated with our instructional activities.&amp;nbsp; Only a small number of Ph.D. students are admitted each year, enabling students to work closely with faculty members. </td>

    <td itemprop="description" class="hidden">The UA Zuckerman College of Public Health is committed to offering professional and academic doctoral degree programs designed to prepare individuals for challenging careers in public health at the local, national and international level. These programs are adept at integrating academic learning with public health practice to ensure a diverse and well-rounded educational experience. Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) There are two areas of study available to DrPH candidates: &amp;nbsp;Maternal and Child Health&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;Public Health Policy and Management. The DrPH is an advanced, professional degree program designed for the student who has a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree or its equivalent and who intends to pursue a leadership career as a public health professional. The DrPH program is unique as it focuses on developing future leaders in public health practice, who will advance the public&amp;rsquo;s health through the integration and application of a broad range of knowledge and analytical skills in leadership, practice, policy analysis, research, program management and professional communication. The DrPH program prepares these individuals to translate scientific knowledge into community-based programs that improve the health status of communities, identify solutions to community health problems, and provide leadership in public health policy and management within both academic and nonacademic settings, as well as in public-agency or private-sector settings that emphasize improving the health of the public. It follows that public health workers from the state and region with the requisite experience and subsequent training will be best suited and prepared for creating the administrative infrastructure necessary for promotion of a healthy public and amelioration of current public health issues in the region. There are two key examinations associated with the DrPH program that indicate a student&amp;rsquo;s progress toward obtaining the degree. The DrPH program requires students to complete a written and oral comprehensive doctoral examinations and a dissertation defense. The&amp;nbsp;DrPH competencies&amp;nbsp;guide the development of the program curriculum and learning activities for the core and required courses in the DrPH curriculum. &amp;nbsp;This posted list of competencies&amp;nbsp;also provides applicants, students, employers and other stakeholders information about the knowledge foundation and skills of graduates from the MEZCOPH DrPH program. The DrPH course requirements are determined by the DrPH Section that offers the DrPH area of study.&amp;nbsp; Students should be aware that some of the coursework for the DrPH have pre-requisites; therefore, students work with their Faculty Advisor to plan their coursework accordingly.&amp;nbsp; In addition, students without an MPH degree will be required to complete the five core MPH courses.

Students have the potential to experience the breadth of public health in the bachelors program and focus on gaining environmental and occupational health (EOH) expertise in the&amp;nbsp;Master of Public Health&amp;nbsp;program. The combined, structured degree enables students to carefully choose electives that prepare them for the advanced courses and provide a broader exposure to EOH in 5 years instead of the 6 years that would be required to complete the degrees separately. EOH specialists focus on the exposure of people to physical, biological and chemical hazards in the environment or workplace and their impact on health. Students can focus on either industrial hygiene or a broader environmental and occupational health track. The accelerated program covers the same information and addresses the same competencies as the two separate degrees. Students can replace elementary level courses in the bachelor program with deeper expertise provided in the master level coursework. Students apply to the Public Health major after completion of 56 units of specified courses. Students apply to the combined, accelerated MPH program after completing 75 credit hours of undergraduate work including at least a semester of organic chemistry, calculus, and physics. A full year of calculus is preferred. A GPA of 3.3 or greater during the first two years of the undergraduate curriculum is required. Students are accepted following completion of 90 undergraduate credit hours. Students will begin the MPH curriculum their senior year as an undergraduate. As with the MPH, the internship is initiated during the summer between the first (senior) and second year of the MPH degree. The final report is due the last semester in the program.
