                  <p>The Division I conference of highly selective universities in the Northeast has been among the most conservative in the country when it comes to competing during the health crisis. It was the first major college conference to abandon sports competition last spring, and it <a href="https://ivyleague.com/news/2020/11/12/general-ivy-league-outlines-intercollegiate-athletics-plans-no-competition-for-winter-sports.aspx">canceled its winter seasons</a> in early November and opted not to play fall sports this spring, as some other leagues did.</p> 
                  <p>League officials said local, non-league competition may be possible later in the spring "if public health conditions improve sufficiently."</p> 
                  <p>The decision was necessitated by trying to keep the Ivy campuses safe, the presidents of the universities said in a joint statement. "The ability of the league’s members to continue on-campus operations during the ongoing pandemic requires rigorous limitations on travel, visitors, gatherings, and other elements that are essential for intercollegiate athletics competition," the statement said.</p> 
                  <p>It continued: "We know that this news will come as a disappointment to many in our community. We regret the many sacrifices that have been required in response to the pandemic, and we appreciate the resilience of our student-athletes, coaches and staff in the face of adversity during this difficult and unusual year."</p>

                  <p>During the fall, most test results were available within 24 hours. In the spring, 80&nbsp;percent of test results will be available 12 to 18 hours after collection.

                  <p>In addition, to discourage travel, all students will have one of their weekly tests on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.</p>

                  <p>Although many universities have begun vaccinating workers in health-care roles, the state of West Virginia is early in beginning vaccinations for faculty and staff more broadly.

                  <p>Jessica Tice, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, said 28 of the state's 43 universities started vaccinating faculty and staff beginning last week.</p> 
                  <p>“The initial allocation for the higher education system was 1,000 total doses, to be given last week; 1,000 more doses were received by the higher education system today, to be given this week,” Tice said via email on Tuesday. “Second doses will be provided per manufacturer’s recommendations. Colleges are responsible for following the guidelines for prioritization set by the state. Specifically, those receiving the vaccine in this first wave must be over 50-years-old and working on campus, or be in a high-risk position such as health sciences faculty or campus security.”</p>

The university "strongly encourages" students to delay their return to the public university campus in western Pennsylvania until just before the Feb.&nbsp;8 start of in-person classes. "Statewide cases remain high. The rollout of vaccines has been slower than anticipated. And the number of cases resulting from New Year’s gatherings won’t be clear for another two weeks," the university's statement read.</li>

"On February&nbsp;1, we will resume our engaged learning experience for a full semester (with the same number of instructional days as usual), to conclude on May&nbsp;12," President Beth Paul said in an email to students and employees. "We will continue with vigilant COVID-19 safety protocols so as to protect our in-person learning and on-campus experiences for our students. And we will continue to prepare proactively for engaging in the COVID-19 vaccination effort and emerging from the pandemic."</li>

                  <p>Student alcohol users who switched from living with peers to parents decreased the number of days they drank per week, from 3.1 before closure to 2.7 after.

                  <p>"We call on UNC administrators to put public health first, to show courageous leadership and to accept the realities that the unchecked coronavirus has created for us all. Deciding now to go remote for the spring will allow students and their families time to plan for the spring semester. It will also save lives in communities across the state and nation until the pandemic is brought under control," the letter says.</p> 
                  <p>While the letter notes that there are better plans in place than was the case for the fall, when the university abandoned plans to open, it says there are too many dangers to resume operations.</p>

                  <p><strong>Nov. 24, 6:23 a.m. </strong>Thomas Brennan, an assistant professor of physical science at Ferris State University, has been placed on leave over his comments on COVID-19 and other subjects.</p> 
                  <p>David L. Eisler, president of the university, said <a href="https://www.ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/archive/2020/november/statement-eisler.htm" target="_blank">in a letter</a> to the campus, "Last week the university learned of racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic slurs made on Twitter that appear to be posted by Thomas Brennan … Individually and collectively we were shocked and outraged by these tweets. They are extremely offensive and run counter to the values of our university and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Our students, faculty, staff and members of the community are upset and offended by these comments, and they should be. As reported Dr. Brennan disrupted a College of Arts, Sciences and Education Zoom meeting last August. At this he expressed via video and chat that COVID-19 death rates in the United States were exaggerated, and the pandemic and rioting were leftist stunts. These comments both surprised and offended those attending the meeting. Dean Williams addressed this in a message to the College’s faculty and staff, and disciplined Dr. Brennan. On Thursday, Dr. Brennan was placed on administrative leave and an investigation is underway."</p> 
                  <p>In <a href="http://www.quantumthom.com/LetterToFerrisCommunity.pdf" target="_blank">a statement to the campus</a>, Brennan said, "This controversy started after I made a few statements in a College of Arts and Sciences meeting of faculty and staff about the COVID-19 pandemic. My statements were to the effect that I believe the COVID-19 pandemic is a stunt designed to enslave humanity and strip us of all of our rights and freedoms. I don’t believe that the pandemic is a hoax, people have died. But its severity is being exaggerated by revolutionary leftists in the media and government who ‘never let a good crisis go to waste.’ The end result of this hysteria, if unchecked, will be a mandatory vaccine. No one will be allowed into public places or permitted to buy food in a supermarket unless they present proof-of-vaccination. Initially, this electronic vaccination certificate will be tied to a person’s smartphone, but will soon after be in the form of injectable micro or nanotechnology in the vaccine itself. If this comes about it will truly be a fulfillment of the prophecy of the mark of the beast, as described by St. John the Apostle in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 13:16-17."</p> 
                  <p>He added, "Let me address a few of these tweets, starting with the one where I used the ‘n-word.’ I believe the ‘n-word’ is a mind-control spell designed to make us hate each other. I am not racist against black people, I love and respect them. But I reject the premise that there are certain magic words that should never be used in any context or by certain people. I uttered the word to try to neutralize its power, and its implied meaning in the context of the tweet was as a synonym for ‘human being,’ or ‘person,’ since I used it to describe people of different races."</p> 
                  <p>Brennan also said in the statement that the atom bomb and the moon landings were "fake."</p> 
                  <p>His Twitter account is now private.</p>

Friends have turned in friends, usually without advance warning, for failing to wear masks and maintain social distancing. Most tips are submitted anonymously online, and they often include photographic evidence or screenshots from Instagram stories. In many cases, the rule-breaking is accidental.

                  <p>"The unanimous decisions by the Ivy League Council of Presidents follow extended consideration of options and strategies to mitigate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, an analysis of current increasing rates of COVID-19 -- locally, regionally and nationally -- and the resulting need to continue the campus policies related to travel, group size and visitors to campus that safeguard the campus and community," the statement read.</p> 
                  <p>The Ivies' decision comes as the fall football season has been increasingly interrupted by cancellations related to mounting coronavirus cases, and just a day after the University of Miami and Stetson University <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/11/12/covid-19-roundup-new-york-colleges-hit-brakes-person-learning-big-time-football" target="_blank">called off their opening basketball game</a>.</p>

                  <p><strong>Nov. 12, 1 p.m.</strong> Undergraduates who are studying online this fall rate their learning experience as modestly better than what they encountered last spring -- with greater levels of satisfaction among students who see their instructors taking steps to understand and engage them, according to a new survey of 3,400 undergraduates in the U.S. and Canada.</p> 
                  <p><a href="https://tophat.com/press-releases/student-sentiment-for-fall/">The survey by Top Hat</a>, whose courseware platform is used by about 750 colleges, also finds that nearly three-quarters of students who say their instructors are meaningfully interacting and engaging with them say they are likely to return for the spring semester, compared to less than two-thirds of students who disagree that their professors are doing so.</p> 
                  <p>The survey's findings are a mixed bag for colleges at a time when many of them are being forced, again, to shift to virtual rather than in-person learning.</p> 
                  <p>Students still overwhelmingly say they prefer in-person to online learning, with 68&nbsp;percent believing they are not learning as effectively as they would have had they been in person. Roughly three-quarters of respondents say their online courses lack an engaging experience during class sessions and direct interaction with peers and professors.</p> 
                  <p>But students rated their fall courses as somewhat more engaging and interactive than was true in <a href="https://tophat.com/press-releases/adrift-in-a-pandemic-survey/">a similar survey</a> Top Hat conducted in the spring.</p> 
                  <p>In the spring, 53&nbsp;percent of responding students said they didn't have regular access to their instructors, and 69&nbsp;percent said they lacked engagement with their peers. This fall, those figures had dropped to 48&nbsp;percent and 65&nbsp;percent, respectively.</p>

There was never any intent to prevent students from entering or exiting the site. The fences are being taken down from Friday morning and students are being contacted immediately. Alternative security measures, including additional security patrols, are being put in place. I apologize once again for the issues caused by this incident."</p>

                  <p>"As colleges and universities across the nation make difficult decisions to advance their vital missions this fall, the $55&nbsp;billion in federal support for university-performed R&amp;D (i.e., on-campus research) is at risk. Maintaining the strength of the U.S. research enterprise -- the same research enterprise that has enabled the rapid sequencing of the COVID-19 genome and launched numerous treatment and vaccine studies -- must be a national priority," the letter says.</p> 
                  <p>"We cannot afford to shut down critical projects with long-term national benefits or to postpone projects that provide the hands-on graduate and undergraduate student research experiences necessary to train the next generation of scientists and engineers. In these difficult times, we call upon the federal government to provide the leadership, critical funding, and programmatic flexibility necessary to enable the nation's colleges and universities to continue the U.S. commitment to research, exploration, and new knowledge creation that will power our economy and provide opportunity for all," the letter says.</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 28, 4:35 p.m. </strong>A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6943e5.htm">report published</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday examines a COVID-19 outbreak that affected more than a third of the 45 members of an unidentified Chicago-area university's men's and women's soccer teams this fall.</p> 
                  <p>The report found that the university brought athletes back to its campus in June and required two negative tests before they could participate in team activities. In August one member of the men's team reported COVID-like symptoms to a coach, and said he had attended a birthday party and an unsanctioned soccer match involving the men's and women's teams in the preceding two weeks.</p> 
                  <p>The CDC interviewed all 45 athletes and concluded that there had been 18 social gatherings (in addition to the coed soccer game) during the two-week period. Several of the gatherings were seen as the likely spreading incidents, at which relatively little mask wearing was reported.</p> 
                  <p>"This outbreak highlights challenges to implementation of prevention strategies associated with persuading students at colleges and universities to adopt and adhere to recommended mitigation measures outside campus," the CDC report said. "University protocols mandated mask use during training sessions, and coaching staff members reported universal compliance. However, multiple students reported inconsistent mask use and social distancing at social gatherings, which quickly negated the benefits of pretraining testing, on-campus mask use, and social distancing prevention measures."</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 28, 3:45 p.m. </strong>Private colleges in Florida and New York announced this week that they would complete the rest of the fall term with all virtual instruction.</p> 
                  <p>Bethune-Cookman University, in Daytona Beach, Fla., said in <a href="https://www.cookman.edu/COVID-19%20Precautions-Fall%20Semester%20Conclusion%202020.pdf">a letter</a> to students and employees Monday that today would be the last day of in-person instruction and that it would complete the last three weeks of the fall term virtually. Officials cited a spike in COVID-19 and a desire to "begin reducing the on-campus density for the remainder of the fall semester." Bethune-Cookman's president, E. LaBrent Chrite, encouraged the historically Black institution's students to "expedite their planned departure from campus beginning this week," if they are able to, but said they could remain on campus through Nov.&nbsp;20. Those who remain will operate under a shelter-in-place order and a curfew.</p> 
                  <p>Bethune-Cookman also became the first institution in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I to cancel competition for the rest of the 2020-21 academic year.</p> 
                  <p>"The recent spike in COVID-19 positivity rates in the state, across Volusia County and on our campus, provides clear and unambiguous evidence, in our view, that now is simply not the time to resume athletic competition," Chrite wrote. "While the decision to opt out of spring competition is the only responsible one for us at this time, it was not made lightly. We know that this decision greatly impacts our student athletes, our coaching staff, our Marching Wildcats and others."</p> 
                  <p>Keuka College, in New York's Finger Lakes region, began the fall semester with in-person instruction but shifted to virtual learning three weeks ago when COVID cases emerged after a "non-sanctioned off-campus gathering," the college said in <a href="https://www.keuka.edu/blog/keuka-college-complete-fall-2020-semester-remotely">a notice Monday</a>.</p> 
                  <p>Although officials said that the number of cases had fallen from a high of 70 on Oct.&nbsp;15 to about a dozen now, they "decided continuing the remote-learning model is the safest course of action," the announcement said.</p> 
                  <p>Keuka said that students who return home will be eligible for a room and board credit for the rest of the term, and that students who can't leave can remain.</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 27, 5:20 p.m. </strong>The American public is divided over just about everything -- so why <em>wouldn't</em> it be divided over whether colleges and universities should have brought students back to their physical campuses this fall?</p> 
                  <p>A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/26/americans-are-divided-on-whether-colleges-that-brought-students-back-to-campus-made-the-right-decision/">survey released</a> by the Pew Research Center this week finds Americans split down the middle on the question of whether colleges that are providing "in-person instruction did/did not make the right decision bringing students back to campus this fall."</p> 
                  <p>Fifty&nbsp;percent of those surveyed by Pew said colleges made the right call -- while 48&nbsp;percent said they did not. But as will probably surprise no one, the proportions look very different by political party. Almost three-quarters of Republicans (74&nbsp;percent) said that colleges and universities that opened their campuses for in-person instruction made the right decision, while more than two-thirds of Democrats (68&nbsp;percent) said the institutions were wrong to open.</p> 
                  <p>The survey also sought respondents' views about the validity of online education, which many students are encountering even if they are physically on campus this fall.</p> 
                  <p>Asked whether a course taken only online provides equal educational value (or not) to a course taken in a classroom, fewer than one in three Americans (30&nbsp;percent) says it does -- while 68&nbsp;percent say online courses are inferior. Respondents with a bachelor's degree were most likely (75&nbsp;percent) to say an online course doesn't measure up, compared to 64&nbsp;percent of those with a high school diploma or less.</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 23, 2 p.m.</strong> An 18-year-old freshman at the University of Dayton died yesterday, reportedly of COVID-19-related complications.</p> 
                  <p>The Roman Catholic university in Ohio announced the death of Michael Lang, a first-year student in its College of Arts and Sciences, in a message today addressed to students, faculty members and staff members. Lang was from LaGrange, Ill.</p>

Lang left campus Sept.&nbsp;13 “to return home for remote study,” it said.</p> 
                  <p>“We extend our deepest sympathy and prayers to his family, friends, professors and our campus community,” said the message, signed by Eric F. Spina, the university’s president, William M. Fischer, its vice president for student development, and Crystal Sullivan, its executive director of campus ministry. “Campus ministers, housing and residence life, and counseling staff are always available for you and for those you know who may be deeply affected by this loss.”</p> 
                  <p>The university invited campus community members to light a candle of remembrance and pray for Lang in its chapel this afternoon.</p>

The university has since seen several spikes and declines in COVID-19 cases detected, moving between different campus statuses indicating varying levels of outbreak containment and transitioning between in-person and remote learning.</p> 
                  <p>The university’s COVID-19 <a href="https://udayton.edu/coronavirus/case_dashboard.php">dashboard</a> lists 42 active cases and 1,368 recovered cases as of Oct.&nbsp;22. It covers a period beginning Aug.&nbsp;10.</p> 
                  <p>No additional information is available at this time, according to Cilla Shindell, the university’s executive director of news and communications.</p> 
                  <p>Lang is at least the third college student reported to have died from COVID-19 or related complications this fall.

                  <p><strong>Oct. 23, 6:23 a.m.</strong> Michigan State University on Thursday announced the first steps toward a spring semester that will feature more classes in person than this semester, but still far fewer than normal.</p> 
                  <p>"In the fall, only about 40 in-person classes were offered at MSU. This spring, we expect to offer about 400 in-person educational experiences. We will prioritize offering classes that can only be taught in person in order to keep our students on track for an on-time graduation. To protect the health and wellness of the community, most classes still will be offered only as online courses," said <a href="https://president.msu.edu/communications/messages-statements/2020_community_letters/2020-10-22-spring-semester-announcement.html" target="_blank">a letter</a> from Samuel L. Stanley Jr., the president.</p> 
                  <p>In addition, he announced that about 2,500 additional single-occupancy residence hall spaces will be available for those who want or need to be on campus.</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 22, 6:43 a.m. </strong>The Association of American Medical Colleges on Thursday called for <a href="https://www.aamc.org/covidroadmap/testing" target="_blank">a national strategy</a> on COVID-19 testing.</p> 
                  <p>“Seven months after the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 cases continue to increase in most states and in the nation’s capital,” said David J. Skorton, AAMC president and CEO. “At the same time, current testing levels for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are inadequate in identifying the actual number of individuals infected and in suppressing the potential spread of the virus in our country.”</p> 
                  <p>The AAMC's key point is to call for "a clear and transparent national testing strategy with specific methods to calculate diagnostic and screening testing targets, and a mandate that each state implements the standards the same way."</p> 
                  <p>Every person with symptoms and every person in close contact with those who have COVID-19 should be tested, the AAMC says.</p> 
                  <p>In addition, the AAMC called for screening tests for "every person who enters a health care facility for an inpatient admission or outpatient surgery." And it called for "routine testing of every K-12 teacher, all health care providers in hospital settings, and first responders (including law enforcement officers, paramedics, and EMTs)." It also called for the country to "conduct a strategic sampling of incarcerated individuals, residents and staff in homeless shelters, and residents in nursing homes and assisted living facilities."</p>

                  <p>Late Tuesday, the university made another announcement: the Italian authorities messed up and the outbreak, while still bad, isn't nearly as significant as originally described.</p> 
                  <p>"There are no words to excuse the unforgivable error committed yesterday by our laboratory," the Italian health agency told Dallas officials (in Italian) in a letter Tuesday. Instead of there having been 52 positive tests and 26 negative ones among the 78 students, as Peter Hatlie, dean and director of Dallas's Rome program, was originally told, the numbers were flipped, and 26 students were positive and 52 negative, <a href="https://www.udallas.edu/coronavirus/_documents/Letter-to-Rome-Students-and-Parents_Dr-Peter-Hatlie_2020-10-20.pdf">Hatlie wrote</a>.</p> 
                  <p>"We are of course relieved and reassured that the number of positive cases is some 40% lower within our community than reported yesterday," Hatlie wrote.</p> 
                  <p>"As of the writing of this letter, I am in contact with the local health authority to understand the implications of these corrected figures for student and staff mobility in the coming days. Despite their egregious if uncharacteristic miscarriage of duty in recent days, we still need to seek guidance from them in this regard and other respects, including the prospect of follow-up testing, for it is their legal responsibility to protect all citizens and visitors within their jurisdiction.

                  <p>McPhail quarantined after learning he’d been in contact with someone outside the university who tested positive for COVID-19. He received a positive COVID-19 test result about 10 days ago, according to James Perry, chairman of the university's board.

                  <p>One of McPhail’s staff members also tested positive for the virus but has recovered and is back at work. Two Saint Augustine's students have tested positive for COVID-19 since the beginning of the fall semester, and both have recovered, Perry said.</p>

                  <p>Saint Augustine's is a private historically Black university in Raleigh, N.C. It enrolled about 900 undergraduates as of last fall. McPhail only became the university's president <a href="https://www.st-aug.edu/saint-augustines-university-announces-the-appointment-of-dr-irving-p-mcphail-as-the-universitys-12th-president/">in July</a>.

                  <p><strong>Oct. 8, 2:25 p.m.</strong> The New England Small College Athletic Conference on Thursday <a href="https://nescac.com/news/2020/10/8/nescac-news-nescac-presidents-statement-on-winter-sports.aspx">announced the cancellation</a> of the Division III league's winter sports season. The league appears to be one of the first to take this step, with the National Collegiate Athletic Association <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/live-updates/ncaa/ncaa-sports-news-schedule-changes-coronavirus-updates-all-sports">going ahead</a> with winter sports championships, if sometimes with reduced season lengths or tournament sizes.</p> 
                  <p>The presidents of the league's members, which include 11 selective liberal arts colleges in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts and New York, said that changes in many of the institutions' academic calendars for the spring semester meant that many students would not return to their campuses until late January or early February, cutting deeply into the traditional season of intra-conference competition.</p> 
                  <p>Middlebury College, for instance, <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/office/midd2021/announcements/j-term-spring-semester-announcements">announced today</a> that it would hold its January term virtually and that students would return for the spring two weeks later than normal, in late February. <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/president/writings-and-addresses/messages-to-the-community/2020/oct-5.html">Bowdoin College said</a> this week that it would bring sophomores, juniors and seniors to campus for the spring term, also two weeks later than usual.</p> 
                  <p>"We understand this decision will disappoint many of our students, given the important role athletics plays in the student experience," the statement read. "We remain committed to providing meaningful opportunities for our students to engage in athletic activities. Students may continue to participate in practice activities, strength and conditioning, skill development and leadership programming in accordance with NCAA, Conference and institutional policies, as well as state and local health guidelines."</p> 
                  <p>The league also said that members "may schedule outside competition at their discretion." The NESCAC members are Amherst, Bates, Bowdoin, Colby, Connecticut, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity and Williams Colleges, and Tufts and Wesleyan Universities.</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 8, 6:28 a.m.</strong> A top journal endorsed Joe Biden for president because the Trump administration is "dangerously incompetent." <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2029812" target="_blank">The endorsement</a>, by <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>, is the first time the journal has endorsed anyone.</p> 
                  <p>"Although we tend to focus on technology, most of the interventions that have large effects are not complicated," the editorial says. "The United States instituted quarantine and isolation measures late and inconsistently, often without any effort to enforce them, after the disease had spread substantially in many communities. Our rules on social distancing have in many places been lackadaisical at best, with loosening of restrictions long before adequate disease control had been achieved. And in much of the country, people simply don’t wear masks, largely because our leaders have stated outright that masks are political tools rather than effective infection control measures. The government has appropriately invested heavily in vaccine development, but its rhetoric has politicized the development process and led to growing public distrust."</p> 
                  <p>The editorial continues, "The response of our nation’s leaders has been consistently inadequate. The federal government has largely abandoned disease control to the states. Governors have varied in their responses, not so much by party as by competence. But whatever their competence, governors do not have the tools that Washington controls."</p> 
                  <p>The editorial does not mention Biden or President Trump by name.</p> 
                  <p>It concludes, "Our leaders have largely claimed immunity for their actions. But this election gives us the power to render judgment. Reasonable people will certainly disagree about the many political positions taken by candidates. But truth is neither liberal nor conservative. When it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent. We should not abet them and enable the deaths of thousands more Americans by allowing them to keep their jobs."</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 1, 3:35 p.m.</strong> A federal judge on Thursday largely <a href="/sites/default/server_files/media/northeastern%20refund%20ruling.pdf">dismissed a lawsuit</a> in which a group of Northeastern University students sought refunds of their tuition and other payments after the university, like most colleges in the country, closed its campuses and shifted to remote learning because of the coronavirus last spring.</p> 
                  <p>Many such cases were filed last spring and summer, and this appears to be the first one decided by a federal court.</p> 
                  <p>In his ruling, Judge Richard G. Stearns granted Northeastern's motion to dismiss the class action on all of the students' demands except for possible refund of the campus recreation fee, which he agreed could proceed.</p> 
                  <p>The two named plaintiffs, Thom Gallo and Manny Chong, undergraduate and graduate students, respectively, had paid Northeastern between $23,400 and $26,100 in tuition, plus several hundred dollars in fees for the spring term. Chong petitioned the university for a refund based on the "pedagogical inferiority of online instruction," and when that was rejected, he and Gallo <a href="https://www.universalhub.com/files/chong-complaint.pdf">filed a class action</a> on behalf of similarly situated students, saying that the university either breached its contract with them or engaged in unjust enrichment.</p> 
                  <p>The judge, citing the annual financial responsibility agreement that students sign with Northeastern, concluded that the university did not commit to providing in-person instruction, invalidating the breach-of-contract claim. Stearns dismissed the claims for refunded student fees because, he said, students pay those fees "to 'support' certain facilities during terms for which those students are enrolled in classes, not to gain access to any on-campus facility or resource."</p> 
                  <p>Stearns permitted the recreation fee claim to proceed because that fee gives students the option to attend home sporting events and to use fitness facilities that were unavailable to them when the campus closed.</p>

                  <p><strong>Oct. 1, 6:23 a.m.</strong> The University of Denver suspended 38 members of the swim and dive team for attending a large off-campus party in violation of COVID-19 rules set by the university, <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/du-swim-dive-athletes-suspended/73-8f5b83e6-da0f-47d6-89d7-b19a9afcbe71" target="_blank">9News</a> reported.</p> 
                  <p>"We will continue to swiftly pursue disciplinary action if members of our community disregard the protocols and public health orders designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19," said a letter explaining the decision. "We can’t have anyone in our community believe they don’t need to abide by DU’s, the city’s or the state’s COVID-19 restrictions while the rest of the community is working so hard to have protocols in place intended to keep everyone safe and healthy."</p> 
                  <p>All of the athletes will be required to test for COVID-19 and are under "location restrictions" until they test negative, the letter says.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 30, 6:30 a.m.</strong> The University of Florida Board of Trustees on Tuesday approved a regulation for <a href="https://regulations.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DraftFurloughPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">a furlough policy</a> that would apply to faculty members, sworn law enforcement and postdoctoral associate employees. "Furloughs are designed to be a proportionate response to such conditions and a job preservation tool, where possible, in lieu of layoffs or other separations from employment," the policy says.</p> 
                  <p>The university said it does not plan to use the policy right now but wants it in place should it lose more money during the pandemic.</p> 
                  <p>Paul Ortiz, president of the United Faculty of Florida Union, said many are worried about the new policy, <a href="https://www.wcjb.com/2020/09/29/university-of-florida-board-of-trustees-approves-draft-furlough-policy/" target="_blank">WCJB</a> reported. “I beg you to first consider the many alternatives that exist to going down the furlough road. I am looking for a firm commitment from the BOT and President [Kent] Fuchs to use the university’s unrestricted net assets and other resources in order to buffer our campus from the types of budget cuts that will negatively impact the working lives and fragile earning power of members of our community already reeling from the global pandemic and the after-effects of the Great Recession,” Ortiz said.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 29, 5 p.m.</strong> The number of young adults with COVID-19 rose by 55&nbsp;percent from early August to early September, as most colleges were bringing students back to their campuses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e4.htm?s_cid=mm6939e4_w">a new report</a> Tuesday.</p> 
                  <p>The federal agency's "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report" found that the incidence of COVID cases among people aged 18 to 22 years increased by nearly 63&nbsp;percent from Aug.&nbsp;2 to Aug.&nbsp;29, then dropped off slightly through Sept.&nbsp;5, accounting for the 55&nbsp;percent rise. The increases were greatest in the Northeast (144&nbsp;percent) and Midwest (123&nbsp;percent). The increases were particularly sharp among white young adults, as seen below.</p> 
                  <p><img alt="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/figures/mm6939e4-F3.gif" style="height: 289px; width: 600px; margin: 10px;" class="b-lazy" data-src="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/figures/mm6939e4-F3.gif" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p> 
                  <p>The CDC study includes its usual disclaimer that the increases in cases "were not solely attributable to increased testing."</p> 
                  <p>The report suggested that multiple factors are likely at play, but said, "Because approximately 45&nbsp;percent of persons aged 18-22 years attend colleges and universities and 55&nbsp;percent of those attending identified as white persons, it is likely that some of this increase is linked to resumption of in-person attendance at some colleges and universities."</p> 
                  <p>It concluded by stating, "Mitigation and preventive measures targeted to young adults (e.g., social media toolkits discussing the importance of mask wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene), including those attending colleges and universities, can likely reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission among their contacts and communities. Institutions of higher education should support students and communities by taking action to promote healthy environments."</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 24, 12:45 p.m. </strong>The public health agency in Boulder County, Colo., on Thursday <a href="https://www.bouldercounty.org/families/disease/covid-19/public-health-order/">issued an order</a> further restricting the behavior of college-aged people in the county, home to the University of Colorado at Boulder. The order from Boulder County Public Health, which takes effect today at 4 p.m. MST, forbids gatherings "of any size" among 18- to 22-year-olds within the county, and requires residents of 36 off-campus facilities (mostly fraternities and sororities) to remain in place for two weeks.</p> 
                  <p>"A gathering is defined as more than one individual coming together or being physically near each other for any shared and common purpose, including socializing or participating in any activity together including but not limited to shopping, dining, or exercising," the order stated.</p> 
                  <p>The county's order follows on the university's <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/chancellor/newsletter/chancellor/shifting-temporarily-remote-instruction-minimum-2-weeks" target="_blank">decision Monday</a> to begin two weeks of remote instruction Wednesday, which itself followed the announcement of a recommended stay-at-home period it began <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/chancellor/newsletter/chancellor/cu-boulder-students-stay-home-notice-effect-stop-spread-covid-19" target="_blank">last week</a>.</p> 
                  <p>The university's chancellor, Phil DiStefano, <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/chancellor/newsletter/chancellor/new-county-public-health-order-begins-4-pm-today">said Thursday</a> that the county's order gives students three options: stay in Boulder and follow the public health guidelines, return to their permanent residences and study fully online for the rest of the spring, or "<span>choose to not follow the rules that protect our community from COVID-19 spread and run the risk of serious health consequences to yourself and others&nbsp;… </span>Please do not choose this option," he wrote.</p> 
                  <p>DiStefano continued, "<span>Like many of our peer universities across the country, we continue to face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some have enacted similar approaches to ours and are successfully reducing their positive cases.

                  <p><strong>Sept. 16, 10:10 a.m.</strong> The Big Ten Conference reversed course on its decision to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/12/big-ten-and-pac-12-postpone-2020-fall-sports">postpone college football</a> until spring 2021 and will instead resume competition Oct.&nbsp;23, the league <a href="https://bigten.org/news/2020/9/16/the-big-ten-conference-adopts-stringent-medical-protocols-football-season-to-resume-october-23-24-2020.aspx">announced Wednesday</a>. The decision applies only to football, and the future of other fall sports “will be announced shortly,” a Big Ten news release said.</p> 
                  <p>The conference, which includes big-time football programs such as Pennsylvania State University, the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, originally decided in August that the medical risks of COVID-19 for athletes called for postponement. The league’s leaders were concerned about a heart condition, myocarditis, that some athletes who previously had COVID-19 are at risk of developing due to heart inflammation while battling symptoms of the virus.</p> 
                  <p>League leaders faced political pressure to resume the season from governors of several states and from the federal government, including United States senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, and <a href="https://bigten.org/news/2020/9/1/general-big-ten-conference-statement-regarding-conversation-with-the-white-house.aspx">even President Donald Trump</a>, who met with Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren earlier this month. Parents of Big Ten athletes also protested the decision and several University of Nebraska football players <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2020/08/27/nebraska-football-players-sue-big-ten-season-canceled/5646062002/">sued the league</a>, <em>USA Today</em> reported.</p> 
                  <p>Along with the decision to resume fall play, the league developed new protocols for testing athletes for COVID-19, cardiac screening and “an enhanced data-driven approach when making decisions about practice/competition,” the press release said. All athletes, coaches and others on the field for practice and games will be tested daily for COVID-19 and athletes who test positive will not be able to return to games for 21 days, the release said. The resumption of practice or games will be determined by the team and staff members’ coronavirus positivity rate.</p> 
                  <p>“Our goal has always been to return to competition so all student-athletes can realize their dream of competing in the sports they love,” Warren said in the release. “We are incredibly grateful for the collaborative work that our Return to Competition Task Force have accomplished to ensure the health, safety and wellness of student-athletes, coaches and administrators.”</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 14, 3:40 p.m.</strong> The University of Arizona and the Pima County Health Department are recommending students on campus and near campus shelter in place for 14 days as the university battles a rising number of COVID-19 cases.</p> 
                  <p>Students following that recommendation, which has <a href="https://twitter.com/uarizona/status/1305556016524713985">also been described</a> as a voluntary quarantine, would still be able to travel to certain activities like essential in-person classes or to purchase necessities like food or medication that can’t be delivered. Leaders are still determining the exact geographic area to be covered by the recommendation. They expect to release additional details later today.</p> 
                  <p>Without intervention, officials worry the coronavirus could incubate among students and spread to more vulnerable populations in the region.</p> 
                  <p>“The university is not an island,” said Dr. Theresa Cullen, director of public health for Pima County, during a virtual news conference today. “It may seem that way, sometimes, but it’s not.”</p> 
                  <p>Local government officials were <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/09/14/covid-19-roundup-isolation-capacity-constraints-staff-layoffs-spring-plans-and">already considering</a> steps like removing pool permits from apartment complexes that host a large number of students. The university has confirmed well over 600 positive cases this month.</p> 
                  <p>Officials during today's news conference blamed off-campus social gatherings for accelerating transmission of the virus. The university has been operating with limited in-person courses since beginning the fall semester at the end of August.</p> 
                  <p>The university’s president, Robert C. Robbins, called Monday’s announcement a “last-ditch effort” to ask students to follow social distancing rules before more drastic changes must be made.</p> 
                  <p>“I’m short of saying ‘I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore,’ because there are only certain things that I can do,” Robbins said. “But this is part of being a good member of society, to take into account the health of others -- not just your individual health, and not just your individual desire to go out and have a good time and party.”</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 12, 2:32 p.m. </strong>Roughly one in six college athletes who contracted COVID-19 later showed evidence of heart inflammation that could be dangerous if they return to play, a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2770645?guestAccessKey=ad3c4563-167f-452a-917f-7bfe15663b06&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=091120">new study found</a>.</p>

Several others showed evidence of previous myocarditis that could have resulted from the coronavirus.</p> 
                  <p>The threat of COVID-driven myocarditis among competitive athletes has been a source of contention in recent weeks. The Big Ten and Pac-12 Conferences opted not to play this fall in significant part because of concern among its member universities about the potentially fatal heart ailment.</p> 
                  <p>Last week, officials at Pennsylvania State University sent conflicting signals about the threat. After the university's director of athletic medicine said at a public meeting that about a third of Big Ten Conference athletes who tested positive for the coronavirus showed signs of myocarditis, university officials sought to correct the record, citing the 15&nbsp;percent figure.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 10, 7:45</strong> <strong>p.m.</strong> The California State University system has announced that all 23 of its campuses will continue to offer virtual instruction for the academic term beginning in January 2021.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 9, 1:30 p.m. </strong>The University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where the number of students with COVID-19 has almost tripled this month, to 612, told students in one of its residence halls Wednesday that they would have to move out to make room for self-isolating peers.</p> 
                  <p>"I recognize that this is unexpected news and that shifting residence halls will disrupt your semester. I am sorry for the disruption, and we are here to support you academically, socially, mentally, and financially," Frank Cuevas, vice chancellor for student life, said in <a href="https://www.utk.edu/coronavirus/updates/massey-hall-relocation-announcement">an email to residents</a> of Massey Hall Wednesday. "I know this is not how you envisioned your semester, and we will work to support you through this. As circumstances evolve on campus we are adjusting our operational plans to help manage through this pandemic, with our top priority being the health and well-being of our campus community."</p> 
                  <p>Like many major public universities, Tennessee is seeing large numbers of students test positive for COVID-19 and much larger numbers in isolation or quarantine. The University of Tennessee System coronavirus dashboard shows a doubling of the number of students in either isolation or quarantine at the Knoxville campus between Aug.&nbsp;31 and Sept. 8, to 2025 from 990.</p> 
                  <p>Tennessee officials said the hotel they had secured was inadequate to house all the isolating students. They chose Massey for the overflow, they said, because of its size and the fact that it has proportionally few students living there now. The students who live there can choose between either moving to another residence hall on the campus or canceling their housing contract and moving back home. The university said it would provide "supplies and staff" to help students move to another room on the campus, and would "make every effort" to keep roommates together.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 4, 10:20 a.m.</strong> As a growing number of colleges and universities struggle to control COVID-19 after resuming in-person instruction, the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative (PRHI) released <a href="https://www.jhf.org/covid19-survey-results/file">results of a survey</a> of public health experts and others on how colleges should respond now to outbreaks of the virus. The more than 100 respondents to the survey included physicians, health-care administrators, students and community leaders.</p> 
                  <p>Colleges should conduct daily saliva testing as well as random sample blood/mucosal testing to track the spread, prevalence and incidence of the virus, the survey found. Respondents said colleges also should have contact tracing capacity in place. The survey found that institutions should run crowdsourced symptom monitoring with as many students and employees as possible, using wearable wrist and bed sensor devices. And it said colleges should require students to wear a device to track their movement and notify students when they are not practicing adequate social distancing.</p> 
                  <p>"The safety of our campuses for students, faculty, staff, surrounding neighborhoods and local health personnel requires vigorous and innovative measures. To date, we have not seen a national strategy to address these outbreaks and ensure the safety of those involved with higher education. The suggestions provided through this survey can help universities answer these difficult questions and make decisions based in science and a public health approach," Karen Wolk Feinstein, president and CEO of PRHI, said in a statement.</p> 
                  <p>Masks should be mandatory for students, the survey said. And colleges should use and enforce codes of conduct to encourage social distancing. The survey also said colleges should not penalize faculty members for choosing to work remotely.</p> 
                  <p>The group of respondents said college leaders should close hot spots for transmission, including bars that violate protocols and fraternity homes.</p> 
                  <p>"Close fraternity houses. Period," the report on the survey's results said.</p> 
                  <p>Respondents urged college leaders to communicate with their local communities about measures institutions have taken to keep them safe.</p> 
                  <p>"Ask the community how they think the university can be a partner in protecting all," the report said. "They did not have a voice in campus reopenings, so engage them now."</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 3, 3:30 p.m.</strong> The United Campus Workers of Louisiana today called for regents to stop face-to-face activities because of the coronavirus.</p> 
                  <p>A statement from the union, which was chartered a year ago and has about 120 members who are graduate workers, faculty members and staff members, focused heavily on the situation at Louisiana State University. LSU has <a href="https://lsu.edu/roadmap/covid-dashboard/index.php">counted</a> a total of 366 positive cases of COVID-19 since Aug.&nbsp;15, with most coming since Aug.&nbsp;25.</p> 
                  <p>More information has been learned about the transmission of the coronavirus since the university created its reopening plans, the union said in its statement. It raised concerns about the risk of transmission in enclosed spaces and from people who are not showing symptoms of the infection.</p> 
                  <p>“In light of these facts, reopening a university system that operates in all 64 parishes in Louisiana endangers everyone in the state, particularly the state’s underserved and high-risk populations,” said the union’s statement. “For the safety of the LSU community and the state at large, United Campus Workers of Louisiana calls on the Louisiana Board of Regents to act in accordance with its ‘constitutional mandate to serve the educational, health care and economic development goals of Louisiana’ and immediately halt face to face activities on campus.”</p> 
                  <p>The statement comes shortly after LSU’s interim president, Tom Galligan, said four student organizations have been charged with violating the university’s code of conduct regarding the coronavirus. Video has surfaced that appears to show off-campus parties with few precautions in place.</p> 
                  <p>“We have seen the videos, and they are very concerning,” Galligan said, <a href="https://www.ksla.com/2020/09/02/investigators-lsu-student-organizations-charged-with-potential-covid-violations/">according to</a> KSLA. “We’re going to investigate, communicate and, as necessary, we’ll enforce.”</p> 
                  <p>Galligan also signaled a high level of concern about the virus’s spread.</p> 
                  <p>“I’m concerned and I’m monitoring and we’re looking at it very carefully, because if it keeps going up, we’re going to go remote,” he said, according to KSLA.</p> 
                  <p>The union does not have a collective bargaining agreement with LSU.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 3, 2:43 p.m.</strong> The University of Dayton announced this afternoon on its COVID-19 <a href="https://udayton.edu/coronavirus/case_dashboard.php">dashboard</a> that the cumulative number of positive cases among students on campus has reached 1,042, including 639 active cases. The rest -- 403 students -- have recovered.</p> 
                  <p>The private university enrolls roughly 11,500 students, including about 9,000 undergraduates, meaning its total positive cases comprise almost 10&nbsp;percent of all students. The university's first day of classes was Aug.&nbsp;24. UD has created five campus status levels for COVID-19, with level five being to largely vacate the campus and have most students leave on-campus housing. The university reached level four last week, which includes pivoting to remote learning while students stay in on-campus housing. It shifted to remote learning last month when cases spiked.</p> 
                  <p>UD in a statement cited a flattening of seven-day averages for new positive cases as an encouraging sign. It said the university has been aggressive with the testing, isolation and quarantining of students.</p> 
                  <p>"University leaders continue to work closely with local public health officials and UD’s panel of local medical experts to monitor, assess and contain the situation on campus," the university said. "We will determine next week what steps to take based on the situation and trends we see at that time. While we hope the trends will indicate that we can return to at least some in-person learning, we also may need to consider further restrictions, including the possibility of moving to fully remote learning, if Public Health believes our campus is contributing to broader community spread."</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 3, 1:00 p.m.</strong> A potentially dangerous inflammation of the heart muscle was detected in about a third of Big Ten Conference athletes who’d tested positive for COVID-19, <a href="https://www.centredaily.com/sports/college/penn-state-university/psu-football/article245448050.html">according to</a> the <em>Centre Daily Times</em>.</p> 
                  <p>Pennsylvania State University's director of athletic medicine, Wayne Sebastianelli, shared the estimate at a State College area school Board of Directors meeting Monday, the newspaper reported. MRI scans showed the athletes in question had myocarditis, an inflammation that can be deadly if not addressed.</p> 
                  <p>“When we looked at our COVID-positive athletes, whether they were symptomatic or not, 30 to roughly 35&nbsp;percent of their heart muscles [are] inflamed,” Sebastianelli said. “And we really just don’t know what to do with it right now. It’s still very early in the infection. Some of that has led to the Pac-12 and the Big Ten’s decision to sort of put a hiatus on what’s happening.”</p>

                  <p>But other major football conferences continue to forge ahead with plans to hold modified seasons.

                  <p>Earlier today, ESPN reported that 21 universities in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Southeastern Conference and Big 12 Conference -- the three conferences making up college football’s Power Five that plan to play sports this fall -- would not disclose data on COVID-19 cases when asked. Almost half of the 65 institutions across all Power Five conferences declined to share data about positive tests recorded to date.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 3, 9:50 a.m.</strong> Four days after announcing a two-week suspension of in-person classes, Temple University in Philadelphia today extended the move for the rest of the fall semester for almost all courses.</p> 
                  <p>Only essential courses -- those that require some in-person instruction to meet educational objectives -- are not covered by the decision. Temple estimates 95&nbsp;percent of its courses will be delivered online for the rest of the semester.</p> 
                  <p>Students in university housing who choose to leave by Sept.&nbsp;13 will receive full refunds of housing and meal plan charges. But students can remain on campus if they want or need to do so.</p> 
                  <p>“We know this is disappointing for the many students and their families who had hoped for an on-campus experience,” said the university’s president, Richard M. Englert, and its provost, JoAnne A.

Unfortunately, the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are simply too great for our students, faculty, staff and neighboring community.”</p> 
                  <p>Two days ago, Philadelphia’s health commissioner declared a COVID-19 outbreak at Temple. The university’s <a href="https://www.temple.edu/life-temple/health-wellness/coronavirus-planning-safe-return/university-communication/active-covid-19-cases-temple-university">COVID-19 dashboard</a> listed 212 actives cases as of 1&nbsp;p.m. yesterday, all among students.

As a result of a rapid increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in our student population in a short period of time, the university is concerned about capacity in the number of isolation and quarantine spaces we can provide. Protecting the health of our Harrisonburg and Rockingham County community -- including students, faculty, staff -- is our top priority, and we need to act swiftly to stop the spread as best we can."</p> 
                  <p>Alger continued, "After consultation with the Virginia Department of Health, James Madison University will transition to primarily online learning, with some hybrid instruction for accreditation and licensure requirements, graduate research, and specialized upper-class courses requiring equipment and space, through the month of September."</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 1, 4:15 p.m. </strong>The Philadelphia health commissioner on Tuesday said there is a <a href="https://6abc.com/colleges-coronavirus-temple-university-covid-19-universities-preventing-covid-at-college/6399124/">COVID-19 “outbreak”</a> at Temple University and told students to “assume everyone around you is infected,” 6ABC reported.</p>

According to contact tracing, the outbreak stemmed from off-campus apartments and small social gatherings, 6ABC reported.</p> 
                  <p>“For any Temple student who is listening to this today, I want to be really clear, and we are asking you to follow this guidance: you should assume that everyone around you is infected,” Thomas Farley, the city’s health commissioner, said during a press conference Tuesday.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 1, 3:58 p.m.</strong> White House officials are worried college students infected by coronavirus will go back to their home communities and spread the disease. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus coordinator, in a call Monday called on governors to urge college presidents in their states not to send students who test positive for the virus home and to keep them on or near campuses.</p> 
                  <p>Not doing so could lead to another national outbreak, Birx said, according to an aide to one of the governors who was on the call, which included Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p> 
                  <p>Birx cited the University of Wisconsin at Madison as an example. The university has set up housing for students to isolate themselves if they test positive, and for others at high risk of having been exposed to quarantine themselves, so that the rest of campus can continue functioning.</p> 
                  <p>The call was first <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-white-house-vp-pence-and-deborah-birx-warn-colleges-not-to-send-covid-19-infected-students-home/">reported</a> by <em>The Daily Beast</em>. The site quoted Birx as having said, “Sending these individuals back home in their asymptomatic state to spread the virus in their hometown or among their vulnerable households could really recreate what we experienced over the June time frame in the South. So I think every university president should have a plan for not only testing but caring for their students that need to isolate.”</p> 
                  <p>Terry Hartle, the American Council on Education’s senior vice president for government and public affairs, said colleges already are doing what Birx urged. “Any college that brings students back to campus will have a clear plan in place to isolate those who test positive and to provide medical assistance to individuals who need it,” he said. “There is simply no way that a campus would go through the extensive planning related to reopening in the COVID environment -- cleaning, testing, tracing and distancing -- and fail to ask themselves, ‘How do we isolate and treat students who test positive?’”</p>

                  <p><strong>Sept. 1, 1:30 p.m.</strong> First Colorado College quarantined students in one of its three residence halls for two weeks after a student tested positive for COVID-19. Then the liberal arts college in Colorado Springs had to do the same with its other two residence halls, just as the first residence hall completed its quarantine period.</p> 
                  <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/coronavirus/">college officials conceded</a> that "despite our rigorous testing and response protocols&nbsp;… our earlier plans to bring the rest of our student body to campus&nbsp;… are no longer feasible." The college plans to deliver classes remotely for the rest of 2020 and require all students not in quarantine to leave campus by mid-September.</p> 
                  <p>Colorado is probably best known for its block scheduling plan, which multiple colleges copied this year presuming that it would give them more flexibility to respond to potential COVID-19-required pivots.</p> 
                  <p>The college's <a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/ipe/cc-covid-19-dashboards.html">COVID-19 dashboard</a> shows only three positive cases (out of 1,111 tests), but it has not been updated since last Wednesday.

                  <p><strong>Sept. 1, 12:30 p.m.</strong> More than 1,000 students have tested positive for COVID-19 at Illinois State University roughly two weeks into the fall semester.</p> 
                  <p>The 1,023 cases the university reported as of Tuesday represent nearly 5&nbsp;percent of its student body, WGLT <a href="https://www.wglt.org/post/how-isu-faring-covid-19-compared-other-midwest-college-towns#stream/0">reported</a>. The university has conducted about 4,400 tests at three locations on campus since Aug.&nbsp;17, and its testing positivity rate for the last week is 24&nbsp;percent.</p> 
                  <p>Illinois State is located in Normal, Ill., which has enacted emergency orders aimed at curbing the spread of infections. One of those orders is a temporary ban on gatherings of more than 10 people near campus. The other in part requires customers at bars and restaurants that serve alcohol to be seated to be served.</p> 
                  <p>University leaders say they have moved 80&nbsp;percent of classes online, are encouraging faculty and staff members to work remotely if possible, and have de-densified dorms. But Illinois State’s on-campus coronavirus testing is reportedly slower and more expensive than tests being used in large numbers at the state flagship, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Illinois State was forced to change its testing strategy after the federal government <a href="https://www.wglt.org/post/hhs-testing-supplies-redirected-isu-nursing-home-initiative#stream/0">redirected</a> testing supplies to nursing homes -- a series of events that contributed to university leaders <a href="https://www.wglt.org/post/isu-shift-mostly-online-fall-after-feds-redirect-testing-supplies#stream/0">deciding</a> to shift plans toward online classes about a month ago, as the start of the semester neared.</p>

                  <p>The "die-in," which was sponsored by the United Campus Workers of Georgia at GCSU union, featured masked and (mostly) physically distanced students and employees carrying signs such as "I can't teach if I'm dead" and "I won't die for the USG," a reference to the University System of Georgia, of which Georgia College is a part.</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 28, 11:05 a.m.</strong> The University of Notre Dame is moving to hold in-person undergraduate classes again in stages starting Wednesday, it announced this morning.</p> 
                  <p>Notre Dame will resume in-person classes after two weeks of remote undergraduate instruction and physical lockdown prompted by spiking COVID-19 infections. The university <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/19/michigan-state-scraps-person-undergraduate-classes-fall-notre-dame-suspends-2-weeks">announced</a> Aug.&nbsp;18 that it was closing public spaces on campus, restricting access to residence halls and asking students not to come to campus while its leaders reassessed plans amid a rising coronavirus infection rate.</p> 
                  <p>At the time, Notre Dame counted 147 confirmed cases since Aug.&nbsp;3 out of a total of 927 tests performed. The university only began classes Aug.&nbsp;10.</p> 
                  <p>When announcing that it plans to resume in-person classes for undergraduates, Notre Dame said that the number of new cases has decreased “substantially.” It cited a positivity rate of 6.3&nbsp;percent from Aug.&nbsp;20 through Aug.&nbsp;25, as well as a positivity rate of less than 1&nbsp;percent among over 1,200 surveillance tests on “members of the campus community.”</p> 
                  <p>The university’s COVID-19 <a href="https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/">dashboard</a> shows 12 new positive cases out of 409 total tests on Wednesday, the last day for which data have been posted. In the first three days of this week, it shows 66 new positive cases out of a total of 1,504 tests.</p> 
                  <p>“With these encouraging numbers, we believe we can plan to return to in-person classes and gradually open up the campus,” the university’s president, the Reverend John I. Jenkins, said in a <a href="https://news.nd.edu/news/notre-dame-to-begin-gradual-resumption-of-in-person-classes-sept-2/">news release</a>.</p>

A Notre Dame spokesman has declined to provide additional information, citing student privacy concerns.</p> 
                  <p>Father Jenkins said he was proud of staff members who have gone “above and beyond their ordinary responsibilities to keep the campus open and safe.” He also stressed those on campus should wear masks, maintain physical distance, wash their hands, complete a daily health check, report for surveillance testing as requested and limit social gatherings to 10 or fewer people.</p> 
                  <p>“The virus dealt us a blow and we stumbled, but we steadied ourselves and now we move on,” Father Jenkins said. “Let us redouble our diligence in observing health protocols and recommit to a semester of learning and growth. Together, we are writing one of the great comebacks in Notre Dame history.”</p> 
                  <p>Colleges across the country have been grappling with the question of how they will decide whether to continue holding in-person classes amid COVID-19 spikes.

                  <p>Crow said he knew that there "has been and will continue to be interest in this number," and he committed to "regular updates about our COVID management strategy."</p> 
                  <p>But in response to an inquiry from <em>Inside Higher Ed</em>, an Arizona State spokesman acknowledged via email that the university did not plan to "have a dashboard/website, etc. with a running total. But we will have regular updates on trends -- and we will be disclosing case counts in the future updates."</p> 
                  <p>University officials have cited privacy concerns as a reason not to publish COVID-19 case data regularly, but experts have dismissed that as a valid reason not to publish information that is not personally identifiable.</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 25, 8:58 a.m.</strong> The University of Southern California resumed classes one week ago, with most of its courses offered online. Residence halls have remained largely closed and the university told students they should not return to Los Angeles for the fall term. Despite these efforts, the university has reported 43 COVID-19 cases among students living in off-campus housing. Over 100 students are now in quarantine due to exposure, according to a memo from Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer for USC Student Health.</p> 
                  <p>"This increase comes despite the continued State and County health guidance that significantly restricts in-person instruction and on-campus activities for universities located in counties that are on the state’s COVID-19 monitoring list, including Los Angeles County," Van Orman wrote. "For students who remain on or near campus in shared living arrangements, we strongly advise you to act with caution and strictly follow all guidelines for physical distancing (6 ft.), avoiding gatherings with other outside your home, wearing face coverings around others to protect against respiratory droplets and proceed with high adherence to hand hygiene and frequent surface contact cleaning."</p>

                  <p>The university's classes began less than a week earlier, on Aug.&nbsp;19. It reported 310 positive cases among nearly 30,000 students who were tested when they arrived on campus. Those cases were not included in the 531 new ones. The university's isolation space for students with the virus currently is 20&nbsp;percent occupied, the system said.</p> 
                  <p>In an attempt to tamp down the outbreak, the city of Tuscaloosa, where the university is located, on Monday shut down its bars and bar service at restaurants for two weeks, <a href="http://www.al.com/news/2020/08/tuscaloosa-bars-shut-down-2-weeks-to-slow-covid-spread-on-alabama-campus.html">AL.com reported</a>.</p>

                  <p>The University of Iowa also began its in-person classes on Monday. It had 107 self-reported cases among students during the previous week, and four among employees.</p> 
                  <p>Alabama's president, Stuart Bell, did not blame students when addressing the spike in cases.</p> 
                  <p>“Our challenge is not the students,” Bell said, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2020/08/university-of-alabama-reports-more-than-500-confirmed-covid-19-cases.html">according to AL.com</a>. “Our challenge is the virus and there’s a difference, folks. What we have to do is identify where does the virus thrive and where does the virus spread and how can we work together with our students, with our faculty and with our staff to make sure that we minimize those places, those incidents. It’s not student behavior, OK. It’s how do we have protocols so that we make it to where our students can be successful, and we can minimize the impact of the virus.”</p>

                  <p>The outages are concentrated on the East Coast, according to <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/zoom/map/">website</a> that tracks outages of online platforms. By about 11 a.m., service was restored for some users.</p> 
                  <p>Students and faculty members at several universities posted about the disruption on social media, including those at <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/tech/zoom-outage-marks-rough-start-to-college-classes/2511277/">Temple and Widener</a> Universities, <a href="https://twitter.com/shannwich_/status/1297893268680855552">Florida State University</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/LindnerLab/status/1297883360459661313">Pennsylvania State University</a>.</p>

As part of a plan to close a deficit of up to $75&nbsp;million in the 2020-21 fiscal year, Iowa said it would end its varsity programs in men’s gymnastics, men’s and women’s swimming and diving, and men’s tennis after the current academic year.</p> 
                  <p>President Bruce Harreld said the university considered several factors in addition to cost-cutting in its decision, including Iowa's compliance with federal gender equity requirements and the state of the sports within the National Collegiate Athletic Association.</p> 
                  <p>"We are heartbroken for our student-athletes, coaches and staff," Harreld said. "We also understand how disappointing this is for our letterwinners, alumni, donors and community members who have helped build these programs."</p>

                  <p>Randy Woodson, the chancellor, <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/fall-semester-undergraduate-classes-moving-online/" target="_blank">wrote</a> that "battling the spread of COVID-19 is a challenging endeavor even when everyone is practicing safety measures. Unfortunately, the actions of a few are jeopardizing the health and safety of the larger community. This week we’ve seen a rapidly increasing trend in COVID-19 infections in the NC State community, including the clusters mentioned above. As of today, through our aggressive contact tracing program we have more than 500 students in quarantine and isolation, mostly off campus, who have either tested positive or have been in contact with someone who has tested positive. We are also investigating other potential off-campus clusters. To best protect the health and safety of the entire campus community, we are making difficult decisions and implementing the following changes to campus operations."</p> 
                  <p>He said that all undergraduate classes would be online, effective Monday. Currently, a majority of classes are online.</p> 
                  <p>Woodson added that students will be able to stay in residence halls. "We understand how important it is for many of our students, and their families, to have the benefits of an on-campus experience, even at this time of reduced operations. For our residential students who want to continue living on campus and receiving the support it provides, you are welcome to stay -- we are not closing on-campus housing," he wrote. "With oversight from dedicated staff and resident advisors, and the continued outstanding cooperation from student residents, we are confident that the spread of the virus can be limited. We’ll continue proactively monitoring the virus with the hope of keeping on-campus housing open throughout the semester. Of course, we’ll change direction if needed in order to protect our students and staff."</p>

                  <p>The university said the students were "endangering not only their own health and well-being, but that of others."</p> 
                  <p>UConn dean of students Eleanor Daugherty and residential life director Pamela Schipani said in letter to all students that those who were evicted did not represent the entire student body. “Our residential community has demonstrated an admirable commitment to follow universal precautions and keep our community safe. In doing so, they have made considerable sacrifice. We cannot afford the cost to the public health that is associated with inviting students into a room for a late night party,” they wrote. “The vast majority of our students are doing the right thing -- but every student needs to do the same.”</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 19, 10 a.m.</strong> Two progressive members of Congress are probing a student housing developer for pressing universities this spring on the financial ramifications of their fall reopening plans and the possibility they would cut housing occupancy amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> 
                  <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Rashida Tlaib, both Democrats, yesterday sent <a href="/sites/default/server_files/media/2020.08.18%20Letter%20to%20Corvias%20re.%20student%20housing.pdf">a letter</a> to John G. Picerne, the founder and CEO of housing developer and operator Corvias. They requested information about the Rhode Island-based company allegedly “putting profits above public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p> 
                  <p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/07/housing-developer-reminded-universities-about-project-debt-they-mulled-fall-plans">As first reported</a> in <em>Inside Higher Ed </em>earlier this month, Corvias wrote to public university officials in at least two states in May, telling university leaders the company had not accepted the risk of universities taking “unilateral actions” that would hurt student housing revenue. The company sent nearly identical letters to leaders at the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/Georgia-Corvias-Letter_0.pdf">University System of Georgia</a> and <a href="https://insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/media/Corvias%20Fall%202020%20letter%20to%20WSU%205-29-20-signed.pdf">Wayne State University</a> in Detroit. Leaders at the Georgia system and many of its campuses where Corvias operates housing <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/08/10/georgia-system-issues-new-statement-housing-decision-making">have denied</a> any outside influence over their reopening decisions, as have Wayne State leaders.</p> 
                  <p>Warren and Tlaib are asking Corvias to provide several pieces of information by Sept.&nbsp;1. They include a list of all higher education partners for which the company manages, operates or builds student housing; copies of all written communications between the company and university partners regarding the status of student housing for the upcoming academic year; and information about whether the company has engaged in any legal action or communications telling colleges and universities they cannot reduce student housing occupancy.</p> 
                  <p>Further, the Democrats’ letter asks if Corvias agrees with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's risk assessments for student housing occupancy, what steps it is taking to reduce risks of student housing residences it manages and if the company consulted public health experts or state officials before making arguments about the number of students housed in buildings. They also seek copies of the agreements between the company and universities and details about how those agreements allow for company profits.</p> 
                  <p>“Reports that Corvias has been pushing for a less restricted reopening of on-campus housing that would be inconsistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines raise serious questions about the nature of these partnerships and the private sector influences affecting campuses as they make important public health decisions for the Fall,” Warren and Tlaib wrote.</p> 
                  <p>Their letter also noted that an investigation of privatized housing in the military raised concerns about Corvias.</p> 
                  <p>“It would be troubling if Corvias was once again prioritizing its profits over the health and safety of its residents,” they wrote.</p> 
                  <p>Corvias has not responded to multiple requests for comment since its May letters were first uncovered.</p>

                  <p>In a videotaped statement, Jonathan Gering, Bethel’s president, said that “approximately 50” of those tested as they came to campus this week had the virus, including 43 students and seven employees.

Some of those identified are already in quarantine, Gering said.</p> 
                  <p>The 43 infected students came from “faraway states and nearby locations as well,” Gering said.

                  <p>He also said that the college had moved to “orange” in its color-coded virus response system, and that students would be discouraged from leaving campus and visitors barred from coming onto campus.</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 17, 4:05 p.m.</strong> The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2020/08/17/shift-to-remote/">has announced</a> that all of its undergraduate instruction will be remote, effective Aug.&nbsp;19 -- nine days after the university held its first in-person classes for the fall term.</p> 
                  <p>The university cited a "spate of COVID-19 infection clusters" in making the decision. Three announced clusters last week were in student housing, with a fourth linked to a fraternity. UNC on its <a href="https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/dashboard/">COVID-19 dashboard</a> reported 130 new positive student cases in the last week, and five positive cases among employees.</p> 
                  <p>Chapel Hill reported a high and rapidly increasing&nbsp;positivity rate among the nearly 1,000 students it had tested as of this morning.</p> 
                  <p>"In just the past week (Aug. 10-16), we have seen the COVID-19 positivity rate rise from 2.8&nbsp;percent&nbsp;to 13.6&nbsp;percent&nbsp;at Campus Health," said Kevin M. Guskiewicz, Chapel Hill's chancellor, and&nbsp;Robert A. Blouin, its executive vice chancellor and provost, wrote to employees.</p> 
                  <p>In addition to shifting its instruction to remote learning, the university said it would continue to "greatly reduce residence hall occupancy," which it said were at 60&nbsp;percent capacity.</p> 
                  <p>Barbara K. Rimer, dean of UNC's Gillings School of Global Public Health, on Monday <a href="https://mondaymorning.web.unc.edu/campus-decisions-who-makes-them-with-what-consequences-and-when-to-change-them/">wrote on her blog</a> that the university should "take an off-ramp and return to remote operations for teaching and learning."</p> 
                  <p>She cited reports of noncompliance with social distancing by students off campus, saying the reopening was not working. "The rationale for taking an off-ramp now is that the number of clusters is growing and soon could become out of control, threatening the health of others on campus and in the community and putting scarce resources at risk," wrote Rimer.</p> 
                  <p>UNC's campus health services reported that 177 students were in isolation Monday, with 349 in quarantine.</p> 
                  <p>"There are no easy answers as the nation navigates through the pandemic. At this point we haven’t received any information that would lead to similar modifications at any of our other universities," Peter Hans, the UNC system's president, said in a written statement. "Whether at Chapel Hill or another institution, students must continue to wear facial coverings and maintain social distancing, as their personal responsibility, particularly in off-campus settings, is critical to the success of this semester and to protect public health."</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 16, 4:41 p.m.</strong> The Faculty Executive Committee at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will hold a meeting Monday to discuss the growing number of coronavirus cases after the university reported a fourth cluster of cases on Sunday, the Raleigh <em>News &amp; Observer</em> <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article245001125.html?" target="_blank">reported</a>. A cluster is defined as five or more cases in close proximity.</p> 
                  <p>Three of the announced clusters were in student housing complexes, and the fourth was linked to a fraternity.</p> 
                  <p>The chair of the faculty, Mimi Chapman, <a href="https://facultygov.unc.edu/2020/08/faculty-chair-letter-to-bog/" target="_blank">wrote</a> to the UNC System Board of Governors over the weekend urging it to give UNC Chapel Hill's chancellor authority to make decisions in response to the pandemic.</p> 
                  <p>“We knew there would be positive cases on our campus. But clusters, five or more people that are connected in one place, are a different story,” Chapman wrote. “The presence of clusters should be triggering reconsideration of residential, in-person learning. However, moving to remote instruction cannot be done without your approval.”</p> 
                  <p>Classes began at the Chapel Hill campus last week. The university opened for in-person classes <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/07/covid-19-roundup-unc-holds-firm-reopening-hopkins-and-umass-pivot-syracuse-suspends" target="_blank">over the objections of the local county health director</a>.</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 14, 4:32 p.m.</strong> The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill informed students, faculty and staff members this afternoon that it has identified two clusters of COVID-19 cases at student housing complexes.</p> 
                  <p>A cluster is five or more cases in close proximity within a single residential hall or dwelling. Those in the clusters “are isolating and receiving medical monitoring,” according to an <a href="https://alertcarolina.unc.edu/notifications/2020/08/14/cases/">alert</a> issued this afternoon. Local health officials have been notified, and efforts are under way to identify others who could have been exposed.</p> 
                  <p>“All residents in these living spaces have been provided additional information about these clusters and next steps,” the alert said. “Contact tracing has been initiated with direct communication to anyone determined to have been a close contact with a positive individual. A close contact is defined as someone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes when either person has not been wearing a face covering. Those identified as a close contact will be notified directly and provided with further guidance.”</p> 
                  <p>The clusters are at the Ehringhaus Community and Granville Towers. Ehringhaus has four-bedroom suites and is heavily skewed toward first-year student residents. Granville Towers are privately managed.</p> 
                  <p>Chapel Hill’s COVID-19 <a href="https://carolinatogether.unc.edu/dashboard/">dashboard</a> shows main campus housing occupancy at 60.7&nbsp;percent as of Monday and Granville Towers occupancy at 76.6&nbsp;percent.</p> 
                  <p>The university cited the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act when issuing the alert. That act set requirements for disseminating health and safety information on campus. But Chapel Hill does not plan to provide details about individual positive cases, citing privacy considerations and laws.</p> 
                  <p>Chapel Hill held its first day of classes Monday.</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 13, 1:30 p.m.</strong> Several medical experts with key roles in advising the National Collegiate Athletic Association offered discouraging words about fall sports competition in a conference call with reporters Thursday, according to news reports.</p> 
                  <p>"I feel like the Titanic. We have hit the iceberg, and we're trying to make decisions of what time should we have the band play," <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/29653444/ncaa-medical-advisers-urge-focus-pandemic-fall-sports" target="_blank">ESPN</a> quoted Dr. Carlos Del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University and a member of the NCAA's COVID-19 advisory panel, as saying. "We need to focus on what's important. What's important right now is we need to control this virus. Not having fall sports this year, in controlling this virus, would be to me the No. 1 priority."</p> 
                  <p>Most college sports conferences have opted not to hold intercollegiate competition this fall, but several leagues that play high-profile (and high-dollar) football are planning to play on.</p> 
                  <p>Dr. Colleen Kraft, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Emory and a member of the NCAA panel, said of the leagues planning to compete: "There will be transmissions [of COVID-19], and they will have to stop their games," according to ESPN.</p> 
                  <p>Officials at the Big Ten and the Pac-12, the two leagues in the Power Five football series that have opted not to play this fall, have especially cited concerns about apparently increased incidence of myocarditis, a potentially deadly heart condition, related to COVID-19. The NCAA's chief medical officer, Dr. Brian Hainline, said on the conference call that between 1 and 2&nbsp;percent of all athletes who've been tested by NCAA members have tested positive for the coronavirus, and that at least a dozen have myocarditis, ESPN reported.</p> 
                  <p>Dr. Kraft said colleges were "playing with fire" regarding myocarditis.</p>

                  <p><strong>Aug. 13, 12:23 p.m.</strong> The recent spate of athletic conference decisions to postpone fall sports means substantial revenue shocks for college athletic departments, and cutting expenses will not always be enough to absorb the blow, according to a new report from Moody's Investors Service.</p> 
                  <p>Because sports are strategically important for universities, Moody's expects universities to provide "extraordinary support" like internal loans in order to stay current on debt payments for athletic facilities. Colleges and universities may tap their financial reserves to close budget gaps tied to the pandemic, the ratings agency said in a report released Thursday morning.</p> 
                  <p>"Athletic expenses have grown significantly in recent years, including certain fixed costs such as debt service, which will impact universities' ability to adjust to the disruption," said Dennis Gephardt, vice president at Moody's, in a statement.</p> 
                  <p>Fall sports cancellations reached a crescendo this week when two of the most important conferences for college football, the Big Ten and the Pac-12, joined many non-Power Five conferences and programs in <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/12/big-ten-and-pac-12-postpone-2020-fall-sports" target="_blank">pulling the plug</a> on fall sports amid COVID-19 concerns. Although the Atlantic Coast Conference, Southeastern Conference and Big 12 were still <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/sec-acc-big-12-still-hoping-play-football-231414757--ncaaf.html" target="_blank">hoping</a> to play football, the ramifications of existing cancellations will be felt across higher education.</p> 
                  <p>Football has been the biggest driver of athletic revenue in the sector. Football contributed $5.8&nbsp;billion in 2018, a whopping 40&nbsp;percent of the $14.6&nbsp;billion in total athletic revenue counted by Moody's. Growth in revenue has been driven by media rights like the payments television networks make for the right to broadcast games.</p> 
                  <p>Disappearing ticket sales will also hit revenue. Although some donor support might be expected to offset losses, a significant portion of donor support comes from seating priority programs -- donors buying the right to pick seats under certain conditions.</p> 
                  <p>This situation is particularly important because the median athletic department broke even in 2018, meaning a significant number of departments lost money.</p> 
                  <p>Moody's called that year a relatively strong revenue year. Still, more than a third of Division I public universities, 37&nbsp;percent, reported expenses exceeded revenue that year. The median operating deficit among that group was 3&nbsp;percent.</p> 
                  <p>Conferences that generate more athletic revenue generally reported better operating performance than others. The financial health of operations varies greatly across athletic conferences.</p> 
                  <p><img alt="" class="caption b-lazy" style="width: 700px; height: 247px; margin: 10px;" title="Courtesy of Moody's Investors Service" data-src="/sites/default/server_files/media/Moodys.JPG" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p> 
                  <p>"Compensation for coaches as well as other athletic support and administrative expenses among NCAA Division I members make up the largest portion of the expense base for a combined 35&nbsp;percent and will be a focus for expense management efforts in fiscal 2021," Moody's said in its note. "With games canceled, universities will save some money on game day operations and travel expenses."</p> 
                  <p>Athletics requires more capital than other arms of higher education. Median debt-to-operating-revenue was 58&nbsp;percent for public higher education overall, compared to 66&nbsp;percent for institutions competing in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Facility expenses and debt service at Division I public universities drove increases in debt between 2013 and 2018, with debt growing 54&nbsp;percent in that period to a total of $2.3&nbsp;billion.</p> 
                  <p>"Given the revenue shocks, many athletic departments will not be able to cover debt service with net revenue from recurring operations, prompting the need to fill the gap from appropriate auxiliary and/or other reserves. In many cases, this is likely to take the form of internal loans that the athletic departments will need to repay the university over time," the Moody's report said.</p> 
                  <p>All of this follows the cancellation of the NCAA basketball tournaments in the spring. Men's basketball accounted for about 15&nbsp;percent of 2018 athletic revenue across higher education. Women's basketball was 7&nbsp;percent.</p> 
                  <p>Still to be determined is how the spread of COVID-19 affects sports scheduled for later in the year and how universities balance pressures on athletics against pressures to other parts of their operations.</p> 
                  <p>"Budget difficulties at athletic departments will add to the financial strains facing universities, including a tuition revenue pinch, reduced state funding and incremental expenses to combat the coronavirus," the Moody's report said.</p>

The postponement also includes winter sports, which are on hold for the remainder of the year, and the conference will consider playing all sports impacted by the decision in 2021, the Pac-12 said in a release about the decision.</p> 
                  <p>Three Power Five conferences, the Big 12, Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference, which include the nation's top football programs and gain most from the sport's financial benefits, have not yet announced postponement of the fall sports season and are moving forward with modified schedules as of Aug. 11.</p>
