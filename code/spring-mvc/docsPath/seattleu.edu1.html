I’m very close with both sides of my family which have lived in the Maryland/Washington D.C. area for a long time. My grandma on my mom’s side is really into genealogy and found that the family has been in Maryland since the 1630s. We have this yearly tradition on my birthday – which is Dec. 24 – where we all get together and have a big celebration. Although my birthday is part of it, it’s mostly about coming together as a family and having some fun. It’s honestly one of the highlights of family time and has been something I look forward to. My family has always been incredibly supportive and in high school would come to all my games, home or away, and that’s been really special to me. They would probably even come to Seattle or Texas or California to watch games if they could. I also have an older sister who was the person that got me interested in volleyball, because as the little sister I just wanted to do everything she for did and follow her around. She doesn’t play anymore but she is definitely one of my biggest supporters and when I committed to Seattle U she was bouncing off the walls and maybe a little bit more excited than I was. I think it’s just because she knew all the work that went into it and all the time we played pepper in the front yard. Although we live on opposite sides of the country, I still talk to my sister and my parents everyday. My grandmother even has FaceTime, so sometimes a bunch of us get on for a family chat. With everything that’s been going on because of the pandemic, I’ve actually gotten closer to my family. It helped me realize that life can be really short and to focus my family and loved ones.” - Nicole Taylor, Volleyball #BlackHistoryMonth","content_date":"2021-02-28T19:11:47-06:00","content_url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CL23KPuAA50/","content_image_url":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/155112344_208382474367844_1590430542481679409_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=s9A6FqUySBgAX8DtIIs&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=a526811b0bc1884ec7c6e83f4eedbc3a&oe=60758606","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CL23KPuAA50/","id":"17916903337579328","tags":[],"comments":[],"likes":{"count":143},"images":{"thumbnail":null,"low_resolution":{"width":null,"height":null,"url":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/155112344_208382474367844_1590430542481679409_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=s9A6FqUySBgAX8DtIIs&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=a526811b0bc1884ec7c6e83f4eedbc3a&oe=60758606"},"standard_resolution":{"width":null,"height":null,"url":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/155112344_208382474367844_1590430542481679409_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=s9A6FqUySBgAX8DtIIs&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=a526811b0bc1884ec7c6e83f4eedbc3a&oe=60758606"}},"caption":{"id":"","text":"“Family is really important to me.

My family has always been incredibly supportive and in high school would come to all my games, home or away, and that’s been really special to me. They would probably even come to Seattle or Texas or California to watch games if they could. I also have an older sister who was the person that got me interested in volleyball, because as the little sister I just wanted to do everything she for did and follow her around. She doesn’t play anymore but she is definitely one of my biggest supporters and when I committed to Seattle U she was bouncing off the walls and maybe a little bit more excited than I was. I think it’s just because she knew all the work that went into it and all the time we played pepper in the front yard. Although we live on opposite sides of the country, I still talk to my sister and my parents everyday. My grandmother even has FaceTime, so sometimes a bunch of us get on for a family chat. With everything that’s been going on because of the pandemic, I’ve actually gotten closer to my family. It helped me realize that life can be really short and to focus my family and loved ones.” - Nicole Taylor, Volleyball #BlackHistoryMonth","created_time":null,"from":null},"video":null,"user":{"id":"17841400563647603","full_name":"Seattle U Athletics","profile_picture":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/104807540_645704006025411_6408903109855966101_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=86c713&_nc_ohc=A8RlsexGoEQAX-ziSfB&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&oh=5453472f4d7db279f6e43be72f9c0e73&oe=60775148","username":"goseattleu"},"date":"2021-02-28T19:11:47-06:00","created_time":1614539507.0},{"content_id":"17895911224835693","content_title":"Seattle’s best","content_date":"2021-02-27T21:50:57-06:00","content_url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CL0klDpgV5I/","content_image_url":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/151422140_2036715276468428_1942095616844752161_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=500abGXwUKEAX8aCwRf&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=47bfae6d87b0c216d2a8d0c5d8b3b287&oe=6075F985","link":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CL0klDpgV5I/","id":"17895911224835693","tags":[],"comments":[],"likes":{"count":232},"images":{"thumbnail":null,"low_resolution":{"width":null,"height":null,"url":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/151422140_2036715276468428_1942095616844752161_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=500abGXwUKEAX8aCwRf&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=47bfae6d87b0c216d2a8d0c5d8b3b287&oe=6075F985"},"standard_resolution":{"width":null,"height":null,"url":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/151422140_2036715276468428_1942095616844752161_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=500abGXwUKEAX8aCwRf&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=47bfae6d87b0c216d2a8d0c5d8b3b287&oe=6075F985"}},"caption":{"id":"","text":"Seattle’s best","created_time":null,"from":null},"video":null,"user":{"id":"17841400563647603","full_name":"Seattle U Athletics","profile_picture":"https://scontent-dfw5-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/104807540_645704006025411_6408903109855966101_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=86c713&_nc_ohc=A8RlsexGoEQAX-ziSfB&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-1.xx&oh=5453472f4d7db279f6e43be72f9c0e73&oe=60775148","username":"goseattleu"},"date":"2021-02-27T21:50:57-06:00","created_time":1614462657.0},{"content_id":"17862149918434251","content_title":"(2/2) “Going to college was essentially a MUST for me.
