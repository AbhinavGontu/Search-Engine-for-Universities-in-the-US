    <h2>Information We Disclose.</h2> 
    <p>We share information with other parties for the purposes stated herein or as required by law. The following categories are the entities we’ve shared information with, including over the past year.</p> 
    <p><strong>Employers</strong></p> 
    <p>We disclose information to employers that utilize our services. For instance, when a job seeker makes their profile information searchable within our Services or responds to a job posting, we will share information with employers in order to facilitate the job search and hiring process. If your current or former employer uses one of our Services, information you input into the Services is accessible by that employer’s end users - subject to the security and access controls set up by the employer.</p> 
    <p>Please note: Job applications and other information submitted to employers are generally controlled and managed by the employer. In those instances NEOGOV is processing that information on behalf of the employer - our Customer. Our legal obligations as a processor are set out in our Customer contracts and policies. If you apply to a job, make your profile viewable to employers, provide information to show interest in a job, or reply to a message from an employer using our Services, you consent to disclosing your information to that employer for their personnel to complete recruitment and hiring processes, contact you for current or future job opportunities, and respond to your support, product, and transaction inquiries.

    <p><strong>Service Providers </strong></p>

For instance, we use service providers to facilitate our support services, data security, email, web hosting, credit card payments, deliver and help us track our marketing and advertising content, deliver payroll processing and disbursements, coordinate our customer conferences, and manage our sales and customer relations. We share information with analytics and advertising companies that may act as our processor and a controller in other instances. We work with other entities to perform research, under controls that are designed to protect your privacy. We publish or allow others to publish insights, presented as aggregated, de-identified, or non-personal data. Where we share information with a party that is not our service provider, such sharing is either at your direction or the direction of our Customers. For example, we share information if you or a Customer chooses to use an integration in conjunction with our Services, to the extent necessary to facilitate that use. Integrations may include payment processing companies, background check and online assessment providers, communication providers, or other independent services Customer chooses to utilize our open API with.</p> 
    <p>We may share non-personal information with affiliated partners and use machine learning techniques on tracking and metadata in order to provide Customers with useful insights from the data they collected using Services, to build or enhance features, improve Services, and improve infrastructure and security.</p>

Please see “Your Data Rights” and “Your California Privacy Rights” for more information on how to exercise your right to optout.</p> 
    <p><strong>Other parties when you give your consent </strong></p> 
    <p>We may also share personal information where you provide your consent or post your information publicly. Where required by law, additional consent is obtained before personal information is transferred to us or forwarded to other parties. For example, we share information with background check providers if a job applicant consents and we are instructed to do so by our Customers.</p> 
    <p>During your use of the Services you may have the opportunity to visit or link to other websites, including websites by third parties unaffiliated with us.

    <p>Excluding purchases of Add-On Services, if you are an employer that holds a separately negotiated commercial contract with us (our “Customer”) that explicitly supersedes or prohibits any end user license or online terms of use, the terms and conditions within such commercial contract shall control to the extent of any direct conflict.</p> 
    <p>Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Services.</p> 
    <ol>

If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Services.

If you use the Services on behalf of a Customer or natural person, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all required authorizations and consents.</p> <p>To access the Services or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information.

All User Contributions must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Terms of Use. Any User Contribution you post to the site will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary.

     <li> <p>Online Purchases; Add-On Services</p> 
      <ol> 
       <li>You may be required to pay fees to access certain add-on features within the Services (“Add-On Service(s)”). Unless otherwise stated by NEOGOV, Add-On Services are governed by the NEOGOV Services Agreement terms most recently published prior to the purchase or renewal of an Add-On Service, as well as these Terms of Use, Service Specifications, and applicable Schedules incorporated therein (available at: <a href="https://www.neogov.com/service-specifications">https://www.neogov.com/service-specifications</a>). Where the terms of this Section conflict with the NEOGOV Services Agreement, this Section shall control. Add-On Services may only be available through one or more of our Services and Add-On Services may not be available for all End Users or Customers.</li> 
       <li>Payment Authorization. You agree to pay to NEOGOV any fees for each Add-On Service you purchase in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Add-On Service. All Add-On Service fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If NEOGOV changes the fees for all or part of the Services, including by adding fees or charges, NEOGOV will provide you notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, NEOGOV may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Services to you.</li> 
       <li>Payment Methods. By providing debit or credit card account information through or to the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that: (1) you are legally authorized to provide such information to us; (2) you are legally authorized to perform payments from the debit or credit card account(s); (3) the credit card information you provide is correct and you will promptly notify NEOGOV of any changes to such information; and (4) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to your use of such debit or credit card account(s) or applicable law. When you authorize a payment using a debit or credit card account via the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete a payment using the debit or credit card account. NEOGOV’s authorized third-party payment processor will charge the payment method you specified at the time of purchase. You authorize NEOGOV to charge all fees as described in these Terms of Use for the Services you select to that payment method, and you authorize our third-party payment processor to use information you provide to process payments, manage debit and credit card information and detect and prevent fraud. In lieu of purchasing Add-On Services via Debit or Credit card, NEOGOV may provide you the option to receive a bill or invoice for payment by alternate means. NEOGOV may align a billing or invoice term with one of your other active Services. Should you elect to receive a bill or invoice for Add-On Service payments, Add-On Service Fees are due net thirty (30) from receipt of NEOGOV bill or invoice.</li> 
       <li>Add-On Service Subscriptions. The Add-On Services may include features that allow for automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“Add-On Subscription”). Unless otherwise agreed by NEOGOV, Add-On Subscriptions will be billed in advance on an annual recurring, periodic basis. NEOGOV may also provide pro-rated pricing terms and align Add-On Subscription invoice or billing with SaaS Subscriptions. If you decide to activate an Add-On Subscription, you authorize NEOGOV to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the recurring payments, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The Add-On Service Subscription Term is a continuous and non-divisible commitment for the full duration of the term regardless of any invoice schedule. The Subscription will commence upon the date you activate or use the Add-On Service. The Subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your Subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your Add-On Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). NEOGOV may change the Subscription Fee for any subsequent Subscription period but will provide you notice of any increase before it applies. Unless otherwise stated in a commercial agreement we negotiated with a Customer, you may cancel an Add-On Subscription by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:accounting@neogov.com">accounting@neogov.com</a>, <a href="mailto:customersupport@neogov.com">customersupport@neogov.com</a>, or alternative means expressly presented to you within the Services.

You will pay NEOGOV for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.</li> 
       <li>Purchase Order. If you issue a purchase order, then it shall be for the full amount, and NEOGOV hereby rejects any additional or conflicting terms appearing in a purchase order or any other ordering materials submitted by you, and conditions assent solely based on the terms and conditions this Terms of Use and NEOGOV Services Agreement as offered by NEOGOV.

      </ol> </li> 
     <li> <p>E-Signatures.</p> 
      <ol> 
       <li>E-Signature Provisioning &amp; Consent. NEOGOV E-Forms and other electronically signed services (“E-Signatures”) are provided by NEOGOV for two counterparties (generally a government employer (the “sending party”) subscribing to NEOGOV Services and personnel or job seekers) to electronically sign documents. If you use E-Signatures offered by NEOGOV, you agree to the statements set forth in this Section. Whenever you sign a document using E-Signatures you affirmatively consent to using electronic signatures via the E-Signatures and consent to conducting electronic business transactions. You also confirm that you are able to access the E-Signatures and the document you are signing electronically. When using E-Signatures for a document, your consent applies only to the matter(s) covered by that particular document.</li> 
       <li>Right to Opt-Out of E-Signatures. You are not required to use E-Signatures or accept electronic documents provided thereby. If you are a job seeker or personnel and you choose to not use E-Signatures, you may still sign the document manually by notifying the sending party that you are choosing to do so and by obtaining a non-electronic copy of the document. NEOOGV assumes no responsibility for providing you with a non-electronic version of the document. In the event you are choosing to sign the document manually, do not use E-Signatures to sign the document or to return the document to the sending party.</li> 
       <li>Electronic Download. If you have signed a document electronically using E-Signatures and transmitted it back to the sending party, NEOGOV provides the opportunity to download and print a paper copy of the document at no charge. If you later withdrawn your consent to using E-Signatures, please notify the sending party and stop using E-Signatures. Note that the decision to stop using E-Signatures after you have already used it does not change the legality of the documents you have previously signed using an electronic signature.</li> 
       <li>E-Signature Validity. PLEASE NOTE THAT NEOGOV’S STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN OR ELSEWHERE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS AND/OR THE SIGNATURE LINES OF DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS LEGAL ADVICE. UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS GOVERNING ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES ON CERTAIN TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE. NEOGOV HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED THROUGH E-SIGNATURE’S ARE VALID OR ENFORCEABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ANY PARTICULAR STATE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL JURISDICTION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH LEGAL COUNSEL CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY DOCUMENT YOU MAY SIGN ELECTRONICALLY USING NEOGOV’S E-SIGNATURE’S.</li>
