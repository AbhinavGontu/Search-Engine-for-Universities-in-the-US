Accounting students learn those skills, as well as how to interpret and communicate financial information in ways that help companies assess trends and make strategic decisions. You will graduate prepared for careers in public accounting such as auditing, taxation, internal audit, government accounting and many other fields. Many students choose to earn a master‚Äôs degree in leadership or taxation.</p>

While archaeologists and biological anthropologists search for clues about the past, cultural and linguistic anthropologists are on a quest to understand the richness of human diversity. Our anthropology program will prepare you for an exciting career involving our increasingly multicultural world and global economy. Careers might include teaching, research, marketing, community service or nonprofit management. Additionally, corporations are increasingly relying on anthropological research to connect with consumers. Employment in this field is expected to grow at a faster-than-average rate in coming years.</p>
