The KU School of Nursing provides the educational foundation that makes all of this possible for you. Since opening its doors in 1906, the University of Kansas School of Nursing has provided the highest quality of education. Our faculty has clinical and academic expertise that is recognized nationally and that places them among the nursing leaders in educational innovations and nursing research.</p> 
    <p>You join a student body made up of students with both excellent academic records and a true sense of caring for individuals that can make a difference in their lives. You will learn to apply the science and art of health care to meet the needs of individuals and the community.</p> 
    <p>On behalf of the faculty and staff of the University of Kansas School of Nursing, I invite you to immerse yourself in learning. Enjoy your time here at the University of Kansas Medical Center with the students in the other health professions as you learn to work together.</p>

    <h2>General Requirements</h2> 
    <h3><a id="ANNOUNCEMENTS" name="ANNOUNCEMENTS"></a>ANNOUNCEMENTS AND COMMUNICATION</h3> 
    <p>Maintaining Accurate Contact Information:<strong> </strong>Every student is responsible for making address and phone number changes in <em>Enroll &amp; Pay</em> as soon as a change occurs.</p> 
    <p>E-mail:<strong> </strong>Upon admission, each student is assigned an e-mail address. E-mail is the official means of communication from the University to the student. It is expected that students adhere to KUMC policies related to <a href="https://kumc-publicpoliciesandprocedures.policystat.com/policy/5086178/latest/" title="policy opens in new tab" target="_blank">proper email usage</a>. The student’s email account also facilitates access to <em>myKUMC</em>, <em>Enroll &amp; Pay</em>, <em>Blackboard</em>, and other online KUMC services. Students are expected to check their KUMC email daily.</p> 
    <p>Blackboard: <em>Blackboard </em>is a learning management system where all online course components are accessed by students<em>. </em>Because all students use Blackboard routinely, announcements are posted on Blackboard. When an announcement is urgent, the posting is also forwarded to student email accounts. Announcements typically include notices of important academic dates, volunteer and job opportunities, and upcoming events of interest, among others.</p> 
    <h3><a id="COMPUTERREQS" name="COMPUTERREQS"></a>COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS</h3> 
    <p>Every student is required to have access to a computer (desktop, laptop, or notebook) that meets <a href="/student-resources/minimum-technology-requirements.html" title="minimum technology standards for KU School of Nursing students opens in new tab" target="_blank">standards approved by the School of Nursing</a>. Nursing students may also utilize <a href="https://library.kumc.edu/services/computers.xml" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">computer equipment</a> located in the Dykes Library. <a href="http://www.kumc.edu/information-resources.html" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">KUMC Information Resources</a> provides various services supporting student computing needs, including access to various software and technical assistance. Faculty and staff office equipment, i.e., computers, copiers, printers, and fax machines, are generally not available for student use.</p> 
    <h3><a name="STUDENTIDBADGES"></a>STUDENT IDENTIFICATION BADGES</h3> 
    <p>Student photo identification badges are required to be worn all times while on campus. Details about distribution of badges is announced during new student orientations. The badge facilitates entry into KUMC buildings after hours. Distance education students (those in web-based and outreach site programs) may request a KU Medical Center photo identification badge by contacting the Office of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management (913-588-1619 or <a href="mailto:SONINFO@kumc.edu">SONINFO@kumc.edu</a>).</p> 
    <h3><a id="DRUGSCREENING" name="DRUGSCREENING"></a>DRUG SCREEN POLICY</h3> 
    <p>Healthcare providers are entrusted with the health, safety, and welfare of patients; have access to confidential and sensitive information; and operate in settings that require the exercise of good judgment and ethical behavior. Additionally, clinical facilities are increasingly requiring drug screening of any individuals, including students, who provide services and care within their facilities, both for safety reasons and to remain in compliance with Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards.</p> 
    <p>Assessment of a student’s suitability to function in a clinical setting is imperative to promote integrity in healthcare services. Clinical observations and rotations are an essential element in certain degree programs’ curricula. A student with a positive drug screen may be barred from certain clinical facilities and thus may be unable to fulfill degree program requirements. Identification of such students prior to clinical rotations will enable appropriate assessment and follow-up.</p> 
    <p>All students receive instructions on how and when to complete the pre-admission or pre-clinical/practicum screening. Students may be required to complete drug testing at multiple points in their academic career depending on affiliated facility requirements. Students are required to have a negative test result prior to proceeding into their first course requiring clinical observations, practicums, rotations or placements.</p> 
    <p><strong>Undergraduate:</strong> Traditional (on-campus) BSN students undergo a urine drug screen (UDS) prior to admission. A confirmed positive test may result in a rescinding of acceptance into the program. RN-to-BSN students undergo UDS if their capstone course requires a clinical experience. When this is the case, the student must complete the screening prior to participating in the required course. A student with a confirmed positive test may be referred to the appropriate student assistance program for evaluation and treatment, possible student disciplinary hearing, and proper disposition through the Student Admission and Progression Committee (SAPC). Community College Partnership students are required to undergo UDS as directed and managed by their respective community college.</p> 
    <p><strong>Graduate:</strong> Graduate students undergo a UDS prior to participating in clinical or practicum observations, rotations or placements. A confirmed positive test may preclude participation in clinical or practicum observations, practicum, rotations, placement at certain facilities, and/or lead to dismissal from the School of Nursing. A student with a confirmed positive test may be referred to the appropriate student assistance program for evaluation and treatment, possible student disciplinary hearing, and proper disposition through the SAPC.<br> <br> The full School of Nursing drug screen policy (Appendix A) is provided in Section XII of this document.</p>

    <h2>Student Organizations and Representation</h2> 
    <h3><a id="STUDENTORGS" name="STUDENTORGS"></a>STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS</h3> 
    <p><strong>Association of Undergraduate Students in Nursing (AUSN)</strong> at the University of Kansas is the body of student government for undergraduates in nursing. The purpose is to provide a means for establishing and maintaining communication, cooperation and understanding among the undergraduate nursing students at the University of Kansas and to promote the welfare of undergraduate students in nursing through participation in designated university and school governance activities. The organization provides an avenue of interaction between the School of Nursing faculty and other student organizations at the University of Kansas including the Student Governing Council. All undergraduate students in nursing at the University of Kansas are members upon enrollment. Officers are elected from the new class in mid-fall semester. A copy of the current AUSN bylaws is distributed to each undergraduate nursing student early each fall semester. Meetings are usually held once a month.</p> 
    <p><strong>Kansas University Student Nurses Association (KUSNA)</strong> and <strong>Kansas Association of Nursing Students (KANS) </strong>is part of a nationwide organization, the National Student Nurses Association (NSNA). The local chapter affiliate is KU Student Nurses Association (KUSNA). It is the only national professional organization for undergraduate students in schools of nursing. NSNA and KANS offer the opportunity to participate now as a change agent and to develop the leadership skills BSN students will need as a professional nurse. NSNA is involved in speaking for all nursing students; it is their voice in nursing and health care. Issues of concern to NSNA include: Student rights and responsibilities, level of entry into practice, recruitment of minority students, community health activities, and national and state legislation affecting the health care system. There are annual state and national conventions, officers at all levels are elected each year, and activities are offered at both state and local levels. NSNA is an autonomous organization but has very close ties with the American Nurses Association (ANA).</p> 
    <p>The local organization (KUSNA) supports activities that promote health by participating in health fair screening programs for children and migrant workers and other programs. Fund raising activities are conducted throughout the year to assist interested members financially when attending state, regional and national conventions. Meetings are usually held monthly or bi-weekly. In addition, the members plan some "just for fun" activities throughout the year that include friends and families.</p> 
    <p><strong>Sigma Theta Tau International</strong> is the honor society of nursing. The Delta Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau at the University of Kansas School of Nursing honors students who meet the eligibility criteria for membership. The purpose of the organization is to foster excellence in nursing.</p> 
    <h3><a name="STUDENTREPRESENTATION"></a>STUDENT REPRESENTATION ON FACULTY AND STUDENT COMMITTEES</h3> 
    <p>Student committee representatives are sought early in the school year. Students have found that participation on these committees are helpful as an added learning experience. Appointments are usually made for the year. Students are encouraged to respond to announcements for volunteers or to contact the Office of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management for more information. The following is a brief guide to faculty committees on which students have voting representation: <br> <strong><br> General Faculty Committee: </strong>This is a monthly meeting of all faculty in the School of Nursing.</p> 
    <p><strong>Research Committee:</strong> This committee reviews proposals of faculty research for funding recommendations to the Associate Dean for Research and makes policy recommendations regarding research and research support issues. The graduate student representative participates fully in the committee's work and also assists in planning KUMC Student Research Forum. Meetings are held monthly.<br> <strong><br> Curriculum Committee:</strong><strong> </strong>This is a faculty group that discusses, among other things, curriculum, independent studies, and plans for the future of the programs. The student representatives provide a communication link between the student body and the nursing faculty. Meetings are usually held twice monthly. <strong></strong><br> Student Admission and Progression Committee:<strong> </strong>This committee reviews problems and discusses issues pertinent to faculty and students, as well as makes policy recommendations and curricular suggestions. Meetings are usually held twice monthly.<strong></strong></p> 
    <p>In addition to faculty committees, graduate and undergraduate nursing students are represented on the <a href="https://kumc.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/SGC" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">Student Governing Council</a> (SGC). SGC is the primary student governing body at KUMC and is a combined council of medicine, health professions, and nursing students. <a href="https://kumc.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/GSC" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">Graduate Student Council</a> (GSC) is the primary governing body for graduate students at KUMC and is comprised of student from medicine, health professions, and nursing.</p>

    <p>is a guide for performing nursing responsibilities in a manner consistent with quality nursing care and ethical obligations.</p> 
    <h3><a name="KANSASNURSEPRACTICEACT"></a>KANSAS BOARD OF NURSING’S KANSAS NURSE PRACTICE ACT STATUTES &amp; ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS.</h3> 
    <p><a href="https://ksbn.kansas.gov/wp-content/uploads/NPA/npa.pdf" title="Nurse Practice Act Statutes &amp; Administrative Regulations PDF opens in new tabPDF" target="_blank">Standards of practice</a> begin on page 25.</p> 
    <h3><a id="KANSASSTATEBOARD" name="KANSASSTATEBOARD"></a>KANSAS STATE BOARD OF NURSING LAW REGARDING DENIAL, REVOCATION, LIMITATION OR SUSPENSION OF NURSING LICENSES</h3> 
    <p>For a number of reasons, the Kansas State Board of Nursing may deny, revoke, limit or suspend a nursing license. These include: fraud or deceit in practicing nursing or in procuring a license; holding a felony conviction; being incompetent; being unable to practice due to abuse of drugs or alcohol; being judged in need of a guardian; exhibiting unprofessional conduct; having violated the provisions of the Kansas Nurse Practice Act; and having action taken against your nursing license in another state.</p> 
    <p>The Kansas Nurse Practice Act states that no person who has been convicted of a felony against persons (as specified in article 34 of chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated and amendments) shall be granted a license to practice nursing in the state of Kansas. In other felony or misdemeanor instances, the Board of Nursing will conduct an investigation and make an individual decision.</p> 
    <p>Admission to the University of Kansas School of Nursing does not guarantee eligibility to test for a nursing license in Kansas if a person's past record includes any of the situations listed above.</p> 
    <h3><a id="KANSASSTATEBOARD2" name="SONCLINRELATIONSHIPS"></a>SCHOOL OF NURSING AND CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS</h3> 
    <p>A cooperative arrangement exists between The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) Hospital Department of Nursing and the School of Nursing. Nursing students adhere to the policies and regulations of The University of Kansas Health System which pertain to safe patient care. In the patient area: no smoking, proper identification (student identification badge), and proper dress. A lab coat may be worn over professional looking street clothes in the patient area, if not giving nursing care. Employment opportunities are available through the Department of Nursing. Interested students may contact TUKHS Talent Acquisition office at 913-588-5627.</p> 
    <p>Various clinical agencies employ University of Kansas nursing students in various job capacities. Students working for clinical agencies must clearly understand that when they work for pay in a clinical agency, they do not represent the University and therefore must not wear anything that designates them as a KU student (such as uniforms, name tags or arm patches). Students are further cautioned to perform only those duties outlined in the job descriptions for which they are adequately prepared, and which are within the legal confines of a non-professional position. University of Kansas liability insurance does not cover nursing students under employment conditions.</p>

    <h2>Academic Policies</h2> 
    <h3><a id="INDEPENDENTSTUDY" name="INDEPENDENTSTUDY"></a>GUIDELINES FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY</h3> 
    <p>In keeping with the philosophy of the University of Kansas School of Nursing, independent study supports the following statements:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Nursing students should have the opportunity to select from nursing courses in order to acquire additional knowledge and skills within a circumscribed area</li> 
     <li>Learning is accomplished best when the learner is involved in the teaching-learning process with the teacher as a catalyst and facilitator</li> 
     <li>Learning situations should stimulate intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and self-awareness</li> 
     <li>Due to the diverse amount of knowledge needed by professional nurses to give optimum care, the baccalaureate, masters, or doctoral nursing student should be allowed to pursue areas of interest in nursing in which there is an opportunity to gain depth and breadth of knowledge in an area of interest</li> 
     <li>Independent study should encourage a student to be self-directive and assume primary responsibility for seeking out learning experiences which meet the student's and the school's objectives</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>No more than 6 credits may be taken as independent study. Appropriate prerequisite courses, as determined by the independent study faculty advisor, must be completed. The procedure for independent study is:</p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>Select a specific area of knowledge to be explored</li> 
     <li>Select a faculty advisor who is an expert in the area of interest</li> 
     <li>The independent study proposal must include:
      <ol type="a"> 
       <li>Title</li> 
       <li>Name of faculty advisor</li> 
       <li>Number of credit hours</li> 
       <li>Name of student</li> 
       <li>Semester for which independent study is requested</li> 
       <li>Purpose of the study</li> 
       <li>Behavioral objectives</li> 
       <li>Methodology</li> 
       <li>Evaluation</li> 
       <li>Selected bibliography documenting area of study</li> 
      </ol></li> 
     <li>A copy of the final paper, project, or clinical evaluation will be submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs through the Student Portal.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <h3><a id="WITHDRAWAL" name="WITHDRAWAL"></a>WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSES OR FROM THE SCHOOL OF NURSING</h3> 
    <p>Students must officially drop or withdraw from courses. Non-attendance does not constitute a drop or withdrawal. Individual courses can be dropped in <a href="https://sa.ku.edu/" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">Enroll and Pay</a> prior to the first day of class for the semester and through the 5th day of classes for that semester. Tuition and fees are adjusted according to the adjustment schedule in the <a href="http://www.kumc.edu/student-services.html" target="_blank">academic calendar</a>. Students receiving financial assistance are strongly encouraged to visit <a href="http://www.kumc.edu/student-affairs/student-financial-aid.html" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">Student Financial Aid</a> prior to withdrawing from classes.</p> 
    <p>A canceled course does not appear on an academic transcript. A withdrawn course does appear on the academic transcript with a grade of W and is not factored into the student's grade point average. In order to completely withdraw, you must contact your academic advisor and the School of Nursing office of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management.</p> 
    <p>In order to withdraw, students should follow the instructions on the Registrar's website: <a href="http://www.kumc.edu/student-affairs/registrars-office/current-students/add-or-drop-a-class.html" title="site opens  in new tab" target="_blank">http://www.kumc.edu/student-affairs/registrars-office/current-students/add-or-drop-a-class.html</a>. The academic calendar for each year is also linked to this site. Please pay close attention to the withdrawal deadlines posted by the Registrar.</p> 
    <p>A withdrawal will not be approved if the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management believes that sufficient information concerning your situation was available to you in time to permit you to consider dropping through the 12th week of classes.</p> 
    <p><strong>Withdrawal based upon illness, disability, or stress:</strong> Generally, petitions based upon illness, disability, or stress will not be approved unless the problem affected your academic performance for at least two weeks during the last part of the semester. Also, petitions will generally not be approved if the problem is a chronic one. The Associate Dean, Student Affairs &amp; Enrollment Management will not be able to determine the validity of these petitions based upon your description alone. You must obtain a letter from a physician, dentist, psychologist, social worker, police, or court official who is involved in your problem. Normally, if the problem was not serious enough to cause you to seek professional help, withdrawal is not justified. The letter should include the following information: a. How your problem affected your academic performance, e. g., your inability to attend class. It is not necessary to state the specific illness, disability, or stressful event. b. The period during which your academic performance was affected. The dates should also be included. c. The periods of hospitalization, bedrest, etc. The dates should be included. d. When the problem began and ended. e. Whether a reduction in class load is recommended.</p> 
    <p><strong>Withdrawal based upon a death:</strong> You must document the death. Generally, this is done by submitting a newspaper clipping or funeral announcement that includes the date of the funeral or death. You must state your relationship to the person who died and the period during which your academic performance was affected.</p> 
    <p><strong>Withdrawal based upon misadvising:</strong> Usually cases of misadvising consist of a University representative giving erroneous information. If your instructor gives you incorrect information concerning the dates or procedures for withdrawal, for example, this would be misadvising. If you were given erroneous information, you should petition and submit a letter from the faculty member, University staff, or University official who misadvised you. This person must accept responsibility for the misadvising.</p> 
    <p><strong>Withdrawal based upon work:</strong> Very few withdrawal petitions based upon work are approved. Usually work situations are long-standing or voluntary. It is your responsibility to assess these situations early and withdraw, if necessary, from the affected classes during the first part of the semester. If late in the semester your performance in a class is affected by a change in your work schedule that is required by your employer as a condition of employment, you should petition and submit a letter from your employer on business letterhead. This letter should include your working schedule for the semester, the changes in your schedule, the date your employment began, the date(s) when the change(s) occurred, and a statement that the change(s) that prompted the petition was (were) required by your employer as a condition of your continued employment. We expect that the University, Athletic Corporation, fraternities, sororities, etc., will not require employment changes that interfere with your classes; therefore, it is unlikely that a petition involving changes in such jobs will be approved.</p> 
    <p><strong>Withdrawal based upon lack of evaluation: </strong>If prior to the end of the first part of the semester, you have received no evaluation of your academic performance in a class, you may be withdrawn from the class. You must submit a letter from your instructor verifying that no evaluation for any work for the class (e. g., homework, paper, quiz, test, etc.) has been made available to you prior to the end of the fourteen days of the semester.</p> 
    <p><strong>Withdrawal based upon enrollment error:</strong> Generally, these petitions concern a course that you thought you had dropped or for which you were not aware you were enrolled. You are responsible for properly dropping a course and for knowing the courses for which you are enrolled; therefore, unless the error is well-documented, it is unlikely that your petition will be approved. If an enrollment error occurred, you should submit a petition and include a copy of your enrollment, copies of drop/ add slips, a letter from your instructor stating when you stopped participating in class, and a statement indicating when and how you became aware of the error. Claims of having dropped a class that are not substantiated by a drop slip are not likely to be approved.</p> 
    <p><strong>Withdrawal based upon other circumstances:</strong> The above are the most common reasons for the approval of a withdrawal petition. It is not possible to state all the circumstances that justify withdrawal. If your circumstances do not fall into one of the categories above and you submit a petition, you should include the following information: a. State the circumstances that you believe justify withdrawal showing how they affected your performance, and when. Be specific. Give the dates during which your performance was affected. b. Provide documented evidence supporting your statements. Petitions which lack necessary supporting documents, or which are in other ways incomplete, will not be acted upon.</p> 
    <p>To withdraw from the School of Nursing a student must make arrangements prior to the cessation of attendance at class or clinical practice. A student wishing to return to the School of Nursing after withdrawing or being dismissed may petition for readmission. This petition will be reviewed by the Student Admission and Progression Committee. The petitioner is responsible for supplying all data requested by the Student Admission and Progression Committee as well as any other information which maybe helpful to the petition.</p> 
    <h3><a name="LEAVEOFABSENCE"></a>LEAVE OF ABSENCE</h3> 
    <p>Students may request a leave of absence if they are not intending to be continuously enrolled. A Leave of Absence (LOA) must be approved by the academic department and Graduate Studies/International Program (if applicable). Student network and e-mail accounts remain active during the LOA period.<br> Policies Regarding Leave of Absence</p> 
    <ul type="disc"> 
     <li>KUMC LOA periods are Fall semester: August 1-December 31; Spring semester: January 1-May 31</li> 
     <li>Students cannot request a LOA for the Summer session</li> 
     <li>Student can only be on a LOA once during a 12-month period</li> 
     <li>Students can only receive a maximum of 2 LOAs per academic program</li> 
     <li>If a student does not enroll for the semester after the LOA expires, they have to submit a reactivation form and pay the Reactivation Fee in order to enroll.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>To request a LOA, contact the appropriate Records Specialist in the School of Nursing Student Affairs Office. The effective date of the LOA is based on the date the student submits the request to the KUMC Registrar's Office.</p> 
    <h3><a id="REACTIVATION" name="REACTIVATION"></a>REACTIVATION OF RECORDS</h3> 
    <p>Students who are not continuously enrolled or on active LOA status (except for the Summer session) must have their records reactivated and are assessed the Reactivation Fee. If a student has not enrolled in over a year, their eligibility to have their status re-activated will be verified with their academic department by the Office of the Registrar.<br> Contact the appropriate Records Specialist in the School of Nursing Student Affairs Office to initiate the Reactivation process. The effective date is based on the date the student submits the request to the KUMC Registrar's Office.</p> 
    <h3><a name="READMISSION"></a>READMISSION TO A SCHOOL OF NURSING PROGRAM</h3> 
    <p>When a student who has withdrawn from the School of Nursing (due to personal reasons, expired LOA status, or academic dismissal) and then wishes to renter the appropriate program in the School, the following procedure should be followed:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Completion of a new application form with application fee</li> 
     <li>Submission of any transcripts which include coursework not already on file in the School of Nursing</li> 
     <li>Statement from the applicant describing his/her activities since the last enrollment in the School of Nursing</li> 
     <li>Statement about the reasons the applicant thinks the request for readmission should be approved</li> 
     <li>These items will be reviewed by the School of Nursing Student Admission and Progressions Committee and the applicant will be informed of the decision</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3><a id="GRADUATION" name="GRADUATION"></a>GRADUATION AND EVENTS</h3> 
    <p><strong>Application for Degree: </strong>During the semester in which s/he expects to complete degree requirements, the student must complete an "application for degree" by the Registrar’s established deadline in Enroll &amp; Pay.</p> 
    <p><strong>Recognition Ceremony: </strong>Each year the Recognition Ceremony honors each nursing graduate individually. Friends and family members are invited to attend. Held the day before University of Kansas Commencement, this academic ceremony commemorates the end of each student's effort to earn their degree in nursing. Awards are presented to students and KU nursing faculty members. The Recognition Ceremony is held at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, 600 North 7th Street Trafficway, Kansas City, Kansas. It should be noted that the official KU commencement ceremonies are held on the Lawrence campus the next day involving graduates from all schools. School of Nursing graduates are encouraged to attend both the School of Nursing Recognition Ceremony and the University Commencement.</p> 
    <p><strong>Commencement: </strong>The University of Kansas holds one <a href="http://commencement.ku.edu/" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">commencement ceremony</a> annually in May. All candidates for all degrees conferred by the University in May, August or December are eligible to participate. One of the distinctive elements of commencement at the University of Kansas is the procession which forms near Strong Hall on Jayhawk Boulevard, continues down Mount Oread, and into Memorial Stadium. Faculty members and graduates wear academic dress which contributes to the pageantry of the event, and bears significance determined by the graduate's field and level of academic achievement.</p>

    <h2>Performance Standards and Policies</h2> 
    <h3><a id="ACCEPTABLEGRADES" name="ACCEPTABLEGRADES"></a>ACCEPTABLE GRADES IN NURSING COURSES</h3> 
    <p>All courses designated "NURS" or "NRSG" must be completed with a grade of C or better to meet requirements for graduation. All undergraduate clinical/practicum courses must be completed with a "satisfactory" to meet requirements for graduation. No student will be allowed to graduate with an "unsatisfactory" in a clinical course.</p> 
    <p>Theory courses are graded on a letter-grade basis. Undergraduate clinical and skills courses are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. Nursing electives with a clinical component may be graded with a combination of letter grades and satisfactory/unsatisfactory or letter grade only. Grades in graduate theory courses and clinical/practicum courses are letter grades. The faculty member(s) for each course establishes the minimum requirements for each letter/satisfactory grade.<br> No undergraduate student may graduate with:</p> 
    <ol start="1" type="1"> 
     <li>nursing GPA below 2.0, and/or</li> 
     <li>cumulative GPA below 2.0, and/or</li> 
     <li>unsatisfactory grades</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p>No graduate student may graduate with:</p> 
    <ol start="1" type="1"> 
     <li>graduate GPA below 3.0</li> 
     <li>below a C in any required course unless repeated with a C grade or above</li> 
     <li>incomplete grade in any required course</li> 
    </ol> 
    <h3><a name="REPETITIONOFCOURSES"></a>REPITITION OF NURSING COURSES</h3> 
    <p>If necessary to maintain the minimum course grade of a "C" or "S", a student may repeat a course once to earn the necessary grade. This practice is allowed one time for a single course in the nursing curriculum. Failure to achieve a "C" or "S" in two nursing courses, or the repeated nursing course, will result in dismissal from the School of Nursing at semester's end. If the second failure is in a course at the end of the first rotation, the student will be prohibited from beginning a new course in the second rotation. The student may complete courses currently in progress.</p>

    <h3><a id="ACADEMICMISCONDUCT" name="ACADEMICMISCONDUCT"></a>ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT - PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY SYSTEM BLUEPRINT (PROFITS)</h3> 
    <p>The purpose of the PROFITS is to:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Promote academic integrity in the student role</li> 
     <li>Explain academic misconduct, and</li> 
     <li>Provide a confidential mechanism for student, faculty, and staff to deal with suspected student academic misconduct</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>The Professional Integrity System (PROFITS) of the University of Kansas School of Nursing affirms the core values that uphold and promote academic integrity. Academic integrity is characterized by the adherence to the basic and fundamental human values of honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility in the academic setting. Academic setting includes formal and informal settings of classroom, clinical, testing, laboratory, research, and all scholarly endeavors. Student behaviors that violate the above core values in the academic setting threaten academic integrity. Academic misconduct compromises the core values of the academic community. It undermines the process of knowledge acquisition, creation, sharing and evaluation. This academic misconduct policy applies to classroom, online and clinical courses.

    <h3><a id="ACADEMICMISCONDUCT2" name="NONACADEMICMISCONDUCT"></a>NON-ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT POLICY</h3> 
    <p>Students and nursing student organizations are expected to conduct themselves as responsible and professional members of the University community. Non-Academic misconduct includes any violation of Board of Regents, University and/or School of Nursing policy as applicable to nursing students, for example substance abuse. While on University premises or at University sponsored or supervised events, students and organizations are subject to disciplinary action for violations of published policies, rules, and regulations of the University, Board of Regents and/or School of Nursing, including, but not limited to offenses listed in this policy.</p> 
    <p>Any student or organization conduct that potentially violates the University’s policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment and retaliation will be reported to the University’s Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access.

    <h3><a id="ACADEMICMISCONDUCT3" name="IMPAIREDSTUDENT"></a>IMPAIRED STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOL OF NURSING</h3> 
    <p>The faculty of the University of Kansas School of Nursing recognize and accept their responsibility to provide an educational atmosphere wherein nursing students may pursue and achieve their academic goals. The faculty also recognize and accept their responsibility to the public, health care institutions, and their clients to provide safe patient care. In support of these beliefs, the faculty concur with the University of Kansas policy prohibiting the unlawful possession, use, manufacture, or distribution of alcohol or other drugs by students or employees on its property or as part of any of its activities. We further believe that impaired nursing students may need assistance in order to free themselves of chemical dependency.</p> 
    <p>The University of Kansas School of Nursing fully acknowledges the stressors students encounter in their professional and private roles and recognizes the impaired student as one whose aberrant behavior interferes with their ability to function according to accepted academic, professional, or social standards. We support participation in treatment programs that have goals to provide a lifestyle free of substance abuse as an option prior to expulsion.

    <p>The student may be removed from the clinical setting temporarily based on the professional opinion of the faculty, if the student is:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Unprepared for the clinical assignment</li> 
     <li>Performing nursing care in a manner detrimental to the patient's welfare. The student may return to the clinical setting upon validation by the faculty that the clinical deficit has been removed</li>

    </ul> 
    <h3><a id="BSNPROFESSIONALAPPEARANCE" name="BSNPROFESSIONALAPPEARANCE"></a>PROFESSIONAL APPEARANCE FOR UNDERGRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS</h3> 
    <p>The University of Kansas Medical Center/University of Kansas Hospital is at once both a campus for education and a hospital complex devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of the sick and the maintenance of health. Thus, it is imperative that health sciences students conduct themselves in such a manner as to maintain both the professionalism which typifies those who dedicate themselves to maintenance of health through education, service and research, and the hygienic conditions conducive to that maintenance of health. Since the student has chosen to become a health professional, it is the administration's view that such professionalism reflected by appropriate behavior, appearance, and personal hygiene should begin on the first day of school and continue throughout the career. All conduct with patients should be in accordance with the guidelines of professional behavior and in the Patient's Rights brochure.</p> 
    <h4>Campus Attire</h4> 
    <p>Students will maintain a professional appearance any time they are attending lecture or representing the School of Nursing off campus. The minimum appearance to be maintained shall be considered “business casual” with the following guidelines: slacks or khakis, dress shirt or blouse, open-collar or polo shirt, optional tie or seasonal sport coat, a dress or skirt no more than 3 inches above the top of the knee, a tailored blazer knit shirt, sweater or cardigan, and loafers or dress shoes that cover all or most of the foot. Denim pants of any kind, leggings worn as pants, t-shirts, shorts, revealing clothing, and flip-flops shall not be considered professional attire by these standards. Students always have the option to wear their clinical uniform to lecture in lieu of “business casual.”</p> 
    <h4>Clinical Uniform</h4> 
    <p>A matching set of scrubs, a top with embroidered KU School of Nursing emblem and pants, and consultation coat, must all be purchased from the KU Medical Center Bookstore. A specific style of consultation coat and scrub uniform will be selected each year for students to purchase. The consultation coat and scrub uniform are to be worn only while the student is in clinical practice, lecture, or lab. No part of this uniform is to be worn in any setting where the student is functioning as an employee.</p> 
    <p>When on the clinical unit performing clinical assignments, the students are required to wear the uniform top and pants. The student's only other variation will be whether or not to wear the approved long sleeve knit shirt under the scrub top. Sleeves longer than the wrist are not allowed. Student uniforms should fit properly and be worn without exposure of the bust/chest, midriff, and/or lower back. Shoes must be closed toe with a solid back and made of non-permeable material; no perforations or mesh are allowed. Shoes must be primarily solid and neutral colors (e.g., white, black, grey, navy, brown) and professional looking. A small logo is acceptable. Shoes such as combat boots or high heels of any type are not acceptable footwear for the clinical area. If socks are visible, they must be white or neutral in color. Each student must wear a digital or analogue watch that displays seconds and is large enough to be easily visible.</p> 
    <h4>Name Badge</h4> 
    <p>Students must wear the official, KU student photo identification badge at all times when at the KU Medical Center or other clinical settings. The name badge should be worn at shoulder level. The name badge will also allow after-hours access to specific areas of the KUMC campus. The photograph for the identification badge will be taken during New Student Orientation.</p> 
    <h4>Clinical Unit Attire When Not Performing Patient Care</h4> 
    <p>When a student is on a clinical unit but not performing patient care, he or she must wear the white consultation coat with campus attire or clinical uniform. The student name badge must be visible at all times<em>. </em></p> 
    <h4>Jewelry, Body Piercing, Tattoos, Hair and Cosmetics, Fingernails.</h4> 
    <ul type="disc"> 
     <li>Jewelry should be kept to a minimum, and may be deemed unsafe for certain clinical settings. Visible body piercings are normally limited to the ears, with simple stud earrings and should not present a safety hazard to patients, employees, or self. (If wearing daith piercing for alleviating migraines, the sum total of piercings may not exceed three.) Non-traditional body piercing/jewelry typically worn on the tongue, lips, eyebrow and nose may not be worn in the clinical setting. In some cases, a clear or flesh colored nose stud may be allowed. (Discrete nose piercing that reflect a cultural tradition will be assessed on an individual basis.)</li> 
     <li>Tattoos are to be covered when wearing the clinical uniform.</li> 
     <li>Hair should be clean, neatly styled and pulled away from the face to keep it from falling forward onto clients or bedside equipment. Male students must have neatly groomed facial hair (beards, mustaches and sideburns).</li> 
     <li>Cosmetics are to be kept to a minimum. Perfumes and/or colognes are to be avoided. Smokers must be sensitive to excessive “smoker’s odor” on hair, clothing and breath. Breath mints are permitted, but chewing gum is not allowed.</li> 
     <li>For all clinical settings hands and fingernails should be well groomed, with the nails trimmed to ¼ inch above each finger. Artificial nails and chipped polish have been found to harbor pathogenic organisms and have been implicated in the transmissions of organisms to patients. Therefore, fingernail polish must be conservative and not chipped and the following are not allowed: nail jewelry, artificial fingernails of any kind including but not limited to tips, overlays, wraps, extenders, gels, and press-on nails.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h4>Policy Enforcement</h4> 
    <p>Nursing clinical faculty supervising students will monitor this policy; however, the clinical agency will also monitor this policy as it involves the safety of their patients. Clinical faculty may send a student home to achieve a professional appearance if so warranted.</p> 
    <h4>Classroom/Learning Lab Setting</h4> 
    <p>In the classroom or lab setting, students are expected to maintain the same professional dress standards as in the clinical setting, detailed in the policy above. If a student exhibits a pattern of unprofessional dress (in violation of policy) in the classroom or lab, the matter will be verbally addressed by course faculty or appropriate graduate teaching assistant. If the student does not change or adapt his or her attire based on this feedback, the student may be asked to leave the classroom or learning lab. If a student is asked to leave class/lab due to inappropriate attire, he/she will forfeit any points associated with that day and may be asked to perform makeup assignments.</p>

    <h2><a name="Graduate"></a>Graduate Programs Protocols</h2> 
    <p>The following information is provided as an overview of graduate program protocols. For more detailed information, consult the Graduate Studies and Research section of this handbook and the current issue of DNP or PhD Student Manuals, both available online in Blackboard or from the School of Nursing Office of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMORIENTATION2" name="GRADPROGRAMPOLICIES"></a>Graduate Studies Policies</h3> 
    <p>The official statement of policies regarding Graduate Studies programs, faculty, and students is in the <a href="http://catalogs.ku.edu/" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">University of Kansas Graduate catalog</a>. The graduate student in nursing is responsible for being acquainted with this information. In addition, consult the <a href="https://catalog.ku.edu/graduate-studies/kumc/" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">Graduate Studies</a> section of this handbook. This information should be read and available for reference by the student. The following are some of the current policies which may be of interest.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMORIENTATION" name="GRADPROGRAMORIENTATION"></a>Graduate Student Orientation</h3> 
    <p>New Student Orientation will occur during prior to the start of class each semester. Newly admitted students will receive communication regarding these orientation activities. The coordination of these activities is done in the School of Nursing Office of Student Affairs &amp; Enrollment Management. The purposes of orientation include:</p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>Students obtain packets of information related to the program.</li> 
     <li>Students complete forms necessary for initial.</li> 
     <li>Students receive an overview of the mission of the University of Kansas Medical Center, the Graduate School, the Graduate Programs in Nursing.</li> 
     <li>Students get acquainted with each other, the campus and faculty members.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMENROLLMENT" name="GRADPROGRAMENROLLMENT"></a>ENROLLMENT IN GRADUATE COURSES</h3> 
    <p>Graduate work is considerably more demanding and involves much more independent investigation than undergraduate study. The School regards 9 credit hours as the normal desirable full-time load in a fall or spring semester; a comparable load in a summer session would be 6 hours. <br> Required enrollment: Course NRSG 935 is the orientation requirement for DNP and PhD students. Every student doing research must be enrolled in NRSG 898 "Research Application in Nursing" or in NRSG 899 "Thesis", NRSG 980 DNP Project, or NRSG 990 or NRSG 999 "Dissertation" when expecting to have consultation with the major advisor. Usually, one would expect to do this on a continuous basis until completion. The student must be enrolled during the semester in which the thesis or project is defended. PhD students must be enrolled continuously in dissertation.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMRESIDENCEREQUIREMENTS" name="GRADPROGRAMRESIDENCEREQUIREMENTS"></a>RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS for the Master of Science Program</h3> 
    <p>Thirty-seven to forty-eight hours are required for completion of the requirements for the Master of Science degree in nursing (M.S.). Thirty hours of resident work must be completed at the University of Kansas. Six hours of transferred graduate credit may be applied toward the total number of hours needed to complete the degree. Only work graded A or B may be transferred. The University of Kansas does not accept the transfer of credit from other institutions for graduate-level courses completed in institutes and workshops.<br> Students planning to transfer graduate credit from other institutions must secure advance approval from the Office of Student Affairs, School of Nursing. After the coursework is finished, the student then submits an official transcript to the Associate Dean, Student Affairs, School of Nursing, showing the work completed elsewhere with a written request to transfer credits.</p> 
    <p>In cases where the student has completed graduate level coursework elsewhere which cannot be transferred, the student may request a waiver of the requirement which that coursework fulfills. However, for Master's students, additional coursework will be required so that the minimum of 30 hours of KU coursework can be met. See the Associate Dean, Student Affairs for details.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMTIMELIMITS" name="GRADPROGRAMTIMELIMITS"></a>TIME LIMITS</h3> 
    <p>Students have 7 years in which to complete the requirements for the Master of Science in Nursing degree and 8 years to complete the Doctoral degree (Ph.D. or D.N. P) in Nursing. Extension of the limit may be granted in exceptional circumstances for up to 1 year at a time by the Graduate Division of a student's school or college upon receipt of a satisfactorily documented petition from the student and a letter of support from the thesis or dissertation advisor. If the program is not completed within the time limit and an extension has not been granted, those courses which are over 7 or 8 years old must be repeated. If, for any reason, a master's student is unable to enroll in coursework in any semester or summer session, the student must notify the Office of Student Affairs. In some circumstances, a leave of absence may be appropriate.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMTIMELIMITS2" name="GRADPROGRAMADVISING"></a>Advising</h3> 
    <p>Graduate students are assigned a program advisor and faculty mentor by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at the time s/he is admitted. As a component of the admission letter, each student receives the contact information for their program advisor and faculty mentor. Functions of the program advisor include the following:</p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>Long range planning with the student for the program of studies for the Master of Science degree in nursing degree</li> 
     <li>Short range planning, i.e., petition for waiver of credit; transfer of credit; independent study; defining clinical and academic needs with student</li> 
     <li>Acting as a support person or referring the student to special services as indicated</li> 
     <li>Sharing honors and awards availability and eligibility requirements</li> 
     <li>Sharing opportunities for financial assistance and eligibility</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p>If a student wishes to change academic advisors, s/he may do so by submitting their request in writing to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management. If the student wishes to change major tracks (Sub-plan), she/ he must complete a Change of Major (Sub-plan) form and submit career goals in writing to the Office of Student Affairs. Notification of approval or denial of the request will be forwarded to the student.</p> 
    <p>Students should have no doubt as to their academic standing and should not hesitate to approach the appropriate graduate faculty members for information on their academic standing and counsel. In each course, the instructor will be glad to discuss the student's work with her/ him. The Associate Dean, Student Affairs &amp; Enrollment Management, the Associate Dean for Graduate Programs, Academic Affairs, or the Dean of the School of Nursing are available for consultation regarding more general questions. An appointment may be necessary.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMGRADES" name="GRADPROGRAMGRADES"></a>GRADES</h3> 
    <p>The basic grading system of Graduate Studies is an A, B, C, D, F, system, where A designates above-average graduate work; B, average graduate work; C, passing but not average graduate work; D and F, failing graduate work. (D and F work does not, of course, count toward a degree.)</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMINCOMPLETES2" name="GRADPROGRAMPGRADES"></a>“P” Grades</h3> 
    <p>The letter P is used in this system only to indicate participation in thesis, dissertation, and research enrollments directly related to thesis or dissertation, or in the first semester enrollment of a two-semester sequence course. When the student's performance is considerably above or below expectations in research enrollments directly related to thesis or dissertation, with permission of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, instructors may assign a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F). Upon completion of thesis or dissertation, as evidenced by the presentation of a thesis or dissertation, a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) shall be reported by the instructor for the last term of thesis or dissertation hour(s) in which the student was enrolled. This grade is to be based largely on the final product. The “I” grade is not appropriate for enrollment in thesis, dissertation, and research and will not be accepted.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMINCOMPLETES" name="GRADPROGRAMINCOMPLETES"></a>Incompletes</h3> 
    <p>For enrollments other than thesis, dissertation, or research, the letter I is used to indicate coursework that has been of passing quality, some part of which is, for good reason, unfinished. The grade of I for graduate courses shall remain unchanged on the student's record except that should the student subsequently complete the coursework, the instructor would then change the I to a letter grade, i.e., A, B, C, D, or F. In addition, the School of Nursing has established a policy that a student in the Master of Science degree program, the Doctor of Nursing Practice program or Doctor of Philosophy in nursing Program has a maximum of one year from the time she/ he receives an I in a nursing course to complete the requirements for the course and receive a grade for the course. The instructor has the prerogative to require a shorter time for completion of the requirements. If the student wishes to receive credit for a course incomplete for longer than 1 year, the student then must enroll and repeat the coursework. Any exception to this rule would be determined by petition to the Student Admission and Progression Committee. The student should inquire with departments outside the School of Nursing regarding their policies for incomplete coursework, because those policies may differ.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMINCOMPLETES3" name="GRADPROGRAMPROBATIONARY"></a>Probationary Policy</h3> 
    <p>If a student falls below a 3.0 GPA in any semester or term, that student will be placed on academic probation. The student attending full-time (9 semester credits) must attain an overall B average in the next semester of full-time enrollment to be removed from probation. Part-time students will be evaluated at the end of each subsequent semester to determine their progress toward raising the overall GPA to 3.0. No more than the equivalent of a semester of full-time study will be allowed on probation. Students admitted on probation will be removed from probation upon completion of the first 9 hours if the overall GPA is above 3.0. If the GPA is below 3.0, the student will face academic dismissal.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMTAS" name="GRADPROGRAMTAS"></a>TEACHING ASSISTANTS</h3> 
    <p>Graduate students who may be interested in assisting faculty members with teaching responsibilities may contact one of the Associate Deans, Academic Affairs of the School of Nursing. Written requests by graduate students may be made as early as one semester prior to the request for employment.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMTAS2" name="GRADPROGRAMRAS"></a>RESEARCH ASSISTANTS</h3> 
    <p>Graduate students who may be interested in assisting faculty members with research responsibilities such as coding data and library searches may contact the Associate Dean, Nursing Grants and Research, who may be able to refer students to faculty who are seeking research assistants.</p> 
    <h3><a id="GRADPROGRAMTAS3" name="GRADPROGRAMKUMCUMKC"></a>KUMC-UMKC COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT PROGRAM</h3> 
    <p>KUMC has an agreement with UMKC which allows graduate students in good standing at KUMC to participate in courses of study or research for a minimum of one semester at UMKC. Please see the “Forms” section at the following link for more information: <a href="http://www.kumc.edu/student-affairs/registrars-office.html" title="site opens in new tab" target="_blank">http://www.kumc.edu/student-affairs/registrars-office.html</a>.

    <h2><a name="APPENDIXA"></a>Appendix A – School of Nursing Drug Screen Procedure</h2> 
    <p><strong>Purpose</strong> <br> The University of Kansas (University) School of Nursing program (Program) requires all students to submit to a urine drug screen (UDS) procedure prior to participating in clinical or practice rotations at any healthcare facility as part of their academic program. As with any community, the University has established standards of conduct for its members. As members of the University community, students are expected to adhere to all published rules, regulations, and policies. Students also are obligated to the laws of the city, county, state, and nation. Students should be fully acquainted with the Kansas University Medical Center (KUMC) and School of Nursing (SON) handbooks.</p> 
    <p>This policy is subject to change at the sole discretion of the University and is meant to supplement other relevant policies, including but not limited to: KUMC Drug Screen Policy, KUMC Policy on Prevention of Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Use on Campus and in the Workplace, School of Nursing Impaired Student Assistance Program, School of Nursing Non-Academic Misconduct, and the Kansas Nurse Practice Act, 60-3-110.</p> 
    <p><strong>Policy</strong> <br> <strong>Undergraduate: </strong>Traditional (on-campus) BSN students undergo UDS prior to admission. A confirmed positive test may result in a recension of acceptance into the program. RN-to-BSN students undergo UDS if their capstone course requires a clinical experience. When this is the case, the student must complete the screening prior to participating in the required course. A student with a confirmed positive test may be referred to the appropriate student assistance program for evaluation and treatment, possible student disciplinary hearing, and proper disposition through the Student Admission and Progression Committee (SAPC). Community College Partnership students are required to undergo UDS as directed and managed by their respective community college.</p> 
    <p><strong>Graduate:</strong><strong> </strong>Graduate students undergo UDS prior to participating in clinical observations, practicum observations, rotations or placements. A confirmed positive test may preclude participation in clinical observations, practicum, rotations, placement at certain facilities, and/or lead to dismissal from the University. A student with a confirmed positive test may be referred to the appropriate student assistance program for evaluation and treatment, possible student disciplinary hearing, and proper disposition through the SAPC.</p> 
    <p>All students receive instructions on how and when to complete the pre-admission or pre-clinical/practicum course screening. Students may be required to complete drug testing at multiple points in their academic career depending on affiliated facility requirements. Students are required to have a negative test result prior to proceeding into their first course requiring clinical observations, practicums, rotations or placements.</p> 
    <p>The SON requires UDS of any student entering extenuating clinical, practicum, rotation or placement wherein a participating healthcare facility requires drug screening. This may include students in the following program categories:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</li> 
     <li>Non-Degree Students</li> 
     <li>NEXus Students</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p><strong>Rationale</strong> <br> Healthcare providers are entrusted with the health, safety, and welfare of patients; have access to confidential and sensitive information; and operate in settings that require the exercise of good judgment and ethical behavior. Additionally, clinical facilities are increasingly requiring drug screening of any individuals, including students, who provide services and care within their facilities, both for safety reasons and to remain in compliance with Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards. Thus, assessment of a student’s suitability to function in a clinical setting is imperative to promote integrity in healthcare services. Clinical observations and rotations are an essential element in certain degree programs’ curricula. A student with a positive drug screen may be barred from certain clinical facilities and thus may be unable to fulfill degree program requirements. Identification of such students prior to clinical rotations will enable appropriate assessment and follow-up.</p> 
    <p><strong>Drug</strong><strong> Test Procedure</strong></p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>Validity Screening Solutions (“Validity”) will be used for all drug screens.</li> 
     <li>All students will be required to complete a 12-panel drug screening. The 12-panel includes Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine, Methaqualone, Methadone, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy), Opiates (Codeine, Morphine, Heroin, etc.), Oxycodone, Phencyclidine (PCP), and Propoxyphene (PPX), Tetrahydocannabinol (THC).</li> 
     <li>Validity provides a written instruction sheet with a username and password for SON students. Office of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management (OSA-EM) Personnel provide the instruction sheet to students, allowing access to the Validity Website to self-schedule the drug screen within 14 days of instruction receipt.</li> 
     <li>Students are responsible for the cost of the drug screen which is collected on-line when the student schedules testing. Collection of the specimen is done at both LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. Both LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics are available nationwide and SAMSHA certified.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>Handling</strong><strong> of Test Results</strong></p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>All positive tests are referred to a Medical Review Officer (MRO) utilized by LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics depending on the site the student utilized for testing. The MRO will speak with the student to ascertain any medications they may be taking that could interfere with or cause a positive test.&nbsp; This review is NOT communicated to the University (for example, a student legitimately on Adderall would initially test positive, but review by the MRO with the student and his/her prescriber would confirm the legitimacy of the prescription and such a test would be reported to the University as negative). If additional processing is required following an initial positive test result, both LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics conduct GCMS processing.</li> 
     <li>Authorized representatives of KU (Associate Dean, OSA-EM or<strong> </strong>her designee) may access final test results which are stored in the Validity database indefinitely. The final results contain a determination that the test was either negative or positive. Positive results, and which panel resulted in that outcome, will be known to the student, as well as, the KU representatives listed above.&nbsp; Test results are confidential and are subject to Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations. Positive results may also be classified as “non-contact positive results” when a student does not provide a prescription for a legal substance or if they do not get in touch with the MRO by a prescribed date. Students will be given up to 48 hours (two business days) to respond.</li> 
     <li>All UDS requested by a student for provision to an outside program that are not part of normal clinical observation or rotation activities, will be ordered through Validity. In that case, results will be released directly to the student for submission to the outside program.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>Resolution</strong><strong> Procedure</strong> <br> All matters related to the disposition of this Drug Screen Procedure will be conducted by the SAPC. The Chair of the Student Admission Process Committee (SAPC) will select a subcommittee to operate in full accordance with all University procedures afforded to ensure proper resolution for the Nursing students as related to the Family Educational and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the University policies.</p> 
    <p>The SAPC Subcommittee will be known as the Drug Screen Committee (DSC). The DSC will review the student case, conduct student meetings and/or hearings as necessary, and recommend further dispositions to determine a student’s ability to proceed with clinical observations or practicum, or rotations as defined within the pursuit of the program and in accordance within the affiliated healthcare facilities rules and guidelines for alcohol and drug testing processes.<br> Five members will serve as DSC members including, but not limited to: the Chair of SAPC, Chair appointed SAPC members, and the Vice Chancellor of Student Services or designee.&nbsp; SAPC members will comprise of faculty and/or ex-officio staff as selected by the Chair. The Senior Director of Counseling and Educational Support is available to consult with the DSC, but will not vote on final dispositions.</p> 
    <p><strong>All</strong><strong> Students prior to participation in a clinical course, observation, practicum, rotation, or placement in the program must:</strong></p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Complete the “Consent to Testing Form”</li> 
     <li>Submit to a UDS at the designated time and place at the expense of the student</li> 
     <li>Utilize the University Contracted Vendor to complete the drug screen test</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p><strong>University</strong><strong> Contracted Vendor will submit test results to the Associate Dean, OSA-EM or her designee.&nbsp; The test results are:</strong></p> 
    <p><strong>Negative </strong> <br> Student has not been found with any level of drugs that will preclude them from continuing to the clinical observation, rotation, practicum, or placement. Student may proceed within their respective program courses.</p> 
    <p><strong>Negative or Positive Dilute</strong><br> A urine specimen with creatinine and specific gravity values that are lower than expected for human urine: (DOT). The urine has more water or fluid than normal. The donor may have been well hydrated at the time of testing. A dilute positive or negative result is possible. If the sample was dilute to the point where the lab couldn’t receive a result, then the test would be cancelled. The student must retest, and incur the cost of retesting, within one week.<strong></strong></p> 
    <p><strong>Positive </strong> <br> If the test is reported as a<strong> </strong>positive result, the student must continue to proceed through the DSC for further resolution and disposition.</p> 
    <p><strong>Non-Contact</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Positive </strong> <br> If a test is reported as a non-contact positive result, the student has provided the specimen as directed by Validity but has not continued to supply further documentation to the MRO from Validity.&nbsp; The student must continue to proceed through the DSC for further resolution and disposition.</p> 
    <p><strong>Refused</strong><strong> To Participate</strong> <br> If a student refuses to participate and not provide a sample specimen for drug testing to the appropriate Validity agency, within a predefined request, then the student must continue to proceed through the DSC for further resolution and disposition.</p> 
    <p>Associate Dean for OSA-EM or her designee, may apprise the SAPC Chair of a student’s positive test result and any additional information that has been provided from the student. The SAPC Chair will determine:</p> 
    <ol type="A"> 
     <li>If additional information is necessary. If so, the SAPC Chair or DSC Designee may gather the information.</li> 
     <li>If enough information has been gathered and found sufficient to convene the DSC for a student meeting or student hearing.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p>After review of the student information, DSC Chair or designated member will contact the student via the appropriate University designated communication media (email, permanent, and/or present addresses) to notify the student of the opportunity to enter a student meeting or student hearing. &nbsp;Information in the notification will consist of, but not be limited to:</p> 
    <ol type="A"> 
     <li>Date and time for the student meeting and/or student hearing</li> 
     <li>Immediate notification of placement on a University administrative leave until further notice</li> 
     <li>Reasons for DSC meeting/hearing and a copy of the policy for student's further review</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>Student Meeting</strong><strong> Selection</strong>: If the DSC Chair decides to convene a student meeting, it should be completed within three academic days of the meeting notification, unless extenuating circumstances prevent this occurrence. A student may also elect to enter a student meeting if they agree or offer to automatically have an evaluation, assessment, and subsequent treatment plan that are mutually agreed to with the DSC Chair and/or members.&nbsp; Student will need to sign a “waiver of a student hearing” form.</p> 
    <p>If the student initially agrees to a student meeting, but does not appear, or a mutually agreeable recommendation does not occur within the meeting, the DSC Chair will apprise the DSC of the need to conduct a hearing. The hearing will be necessary if a possibility of a sanction could be applied that may result in a continued educational leave of absence for a designated time for evaluation and treatment that interrupts the academic pursuit, suspension for a period of time, or dismissal from the University.</p> 
    <p><strong>Student Hearing</strong><strong> Selection</strong>: If all means of acceptable alternatives are exhausted, then a student hearing will commence. The hearing will occur within ten academic days, if possible, of the notification that a positive drug result was received on the student.</p> 
    <p>During the hearing, the student will be allowed to give an explanation for his/her conduct. The student may have an advisor who provides advice and guidance in regard to procedural issues related to the allegation and subsequent hearing. The advisor will have an obligation of confidentiality and may be any faculty member in the School of Nursing, except from the SAPC or DSC. It is the student’s responsibility to contact the faculty member and obtain his/her consent to serve as an advisor. Advisors, at the request of the student they are assisting, will be allowed to attend the hearing and be present during testimony before the DSC.</p> 
    <p>Advisors cannot be present during the DSC discussion and decision. Advisors are not permitted to present testimony at any time during the hearing.</p> 
    <p>The parties will discuss available drug or alcohol counseling and academic consequences. The DSC will decide by majority vote, recommendations for sanctions that will then be provided to the Dean of the School of Nursing.</p> 
    <p>Student agrees to sign a release of information form, if needed, to allow the agency who is conducting the evaluation, assessment, and/or treatment plan to provide recommendations to the DSC. These recommendations may be used to determine re-admission into the student’s designated program.</p> 
    <p>Possible Recommendations and/or Sanctions may occur, but not be limited to:</p> 
    <ol type="A"> 
     <li>Enter into an evaluation and/or treatment agreement with KUMC Counseling and Educational Support Services or a University approved external certified alcohol and drug agent/agency. Determination for evaluation, assessment, and treatment or other recommendations may be provided by the Senior Director of Counseling and Educational Support Services or the University approved external certified alcohol and drug agent/agency. All expenses related to the evaluation, assessment, treatment or other recommendations will be paid by the student. The Senior Director of Counseling and Educational Support Services and/or external certified alcohol and drug agent/agency will provide a report back to the DSC which may be used for final consideration of disposition.</li> 
     <li>Remain in school.</li> 
     <li>Allow student to retest.</li> 
     <li>May be dismissed from courses, clinical rotations, and/or school for a period of time.</li> 
     <li>Failure to complete a second drug test may be grounds to be permanently dismissed from SON Programs.</li> 
     <li>Be dismissed from SON permanently.</li> 
     <li>Student may be asked to complete random drug screening tests upon re-admission or re-entry into the program. All testing will be paid for by the student.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>Additional Resolution Process:</strong></p> 
    <p><strong>Duty to Report</strong>: All students receiving positive test results may be reported to their respective state board of nursing and/or assistance program as is appropriate in the specific circumstances.<br> The Senior Director of Counseling and Educational Support will be used in a liaison role to provide evaluations, assessments, and/or complete treatment programs or a student may choose to use an approved outside healthcare provider.</p> 
    <p>Findings from the hearings will be forwarded to the Dean of the School of Nursing by the SAPC/DSC Chairperson within two academic days after the recommendation(s) have been formulated.</p> 
    <p>Findings will include the DSC's decision of whether or not to uphold the result of positive, non-contact positive, or refusal to test result. The DSC will recommend one or more sanctions to the Dean, who will make a final determination of the sanction(s) to be imposed. Formal written notification of the Dean's decision will be sent to the student from the Office of the Dean within 10 academic days of the student meeting or hearing by certified mail. The Dean’s decision is final and may not be appealed.</p>

     <li><strong>Investigation and hearing of suspected misconduct</strong><br> See Diagram:&nbsp; <a href="documents/son/handbook/ProfitsTimeline.pdf" title="PDF" target="_blank">Timeline for Profits Investigation and Hearing Process</a> (in PDF format) <br> <br> Behaviors described in section II regarding academic misconduct and abuse of academic resources, constitute an occurrence of suspected misconduct within the Professional Integrity System.&nbsp; Occurrences of suspected misconduct will be addressed using the following procedures.&nbsp; Every effort will be taken to process cases as expeditiously as possible by adhering to the time frames established in the following procedure.&nbsp; NOTE: in some situations individual faculty may discover or respond to suspected academic misconduct in his/her own course, conduct an investigation, and apply sanctions without implementation of PROFITS procedures (see <a href="documents/son/handbook/PROFITSfacultyflowchart.pdf" title="PDF" target="_blank">Flowchart #1</a> for Faculty Reporting Academic Misconduct).<br> <br> Confidentiality - An essential element of the Professional Integrity System is confidentiality. Students, faculty, and staff who participate in the reporting, investigation, or hearing of suspected misconduct are bound to confidentiality.&nbsp; All documentation related to suspected misconduct will be secured appropriately.
      <ol> 
       <li>Report of occurrence (See <a href="documents/son/handbook/PROFITSfacultyflowchart.pdf" title="PDF" target="_blank">Flowcharts #1</a> and <a href="documents/son/handbook/PROFITSWitnessflowchart.pdf" title="PDF" target="_blank">#2</a> for Faculty and Student Reporting Academic Misconduct):&nbsp; Any person suspecting misconduct will report the incident in question to a member of the PROFITS Committee, either orally or in writing.&nbsp; Initial reports made by faculty, staff, and students of the School of Nursing must be made within 5 academic days from the day of detection.&nbsp; The PROFITS Committee member will inform the individual reporting the suspected misconduct that it will be necessary to disclose his/her name to the accused student only if the investigation determines that a hearing is needed.&nbsp; When a faculty member reports an occurrence, he/she cannot apply sanctions for any suspected occurrence.&nbsp; The PROFITS Committee Chair will exercise discretion as to whether to proceed with an investigation when a report of suspected misconduct is received outside the usual reporting time.<br> PROFITS Committee members are responsible for reporting occurrences to the PROFITS Committee Chair within 1 academic day of receiving a report of an occurrence.&nbsp; The PROFITS Committee Chair will request a written statement of the occurrence from the person reporting.&nbsp; The PROFITS Committee Chair will appoint an investigator from among the faculty members on the Committee within 1 academic day.&nbsp; All data gathered by the investigator will be documented in writing.&nbsp; The investigator is charged to speak with the person reporting the occurrence, the student in question, and other individuals who may be involved.&nbsp; Confidentiality will be maintained in all cases.&nbsp; In cases where patient safety is a factor, identification of the student in question will be revealed strictly on a need–to–know basis.&nbsp; After data are gathered the investigator will meet with the committee chairperson to determine the need for a hearing.</li> 
       <li>The student in question will be notified by the PROFITS Committee Chair of the suspected misconduct within 1 academic day of receiving the report (See <a href="documents/son/handbook/PROFITSstudentflowchart.pdf" title="PDF" target="_blank">Flowchart #3</a> “What Should I do if I am Suspected of Academic Misconduct in the School of Nursing”).&nbsp; Relevant evidence known to the chair and/or investigator will be made available to the student being investigated.&nbsp; The student in question will be asked to provide a written statement of their account of the incident for the investigation.&nbsp; During the time of the investigation and pending a hearing the student in question is encouraged to continue attending class.&nbsp; The student in question may not drop a course to avoid investigation of alleged misconduct or imposition of sanction if it is found that misconduct occurred.&nbsp; Only if it is found that misconduct did not occur, or if the charges are dismissed, may the course be dropped following the regular procedures of the University.</li> 
       <li>The investigator and the PROFITS Committee Chair will meet within 5 academic days after the appointment of the investigator, to determine whether evidence is sufficient to require a hearing.
        <ol type="a"> 
         <li>If a hearing is to be held, the student in question will be notified, informed of the allegations, told the name of the person who reported the incident and given a copy of the investigators report.&nbsp; The student in question will be informed of the right to select an advisor, call witnesses and/or submit documentation.&nbsp; Each party will be notified of the date, time, and place of the hearing as soon as details are finalized, but no later than 2 academic days prior to the hearing</li> 
         <li>If participating in the hearing, the person who reported the incident will be given a copy of the investigator's report, and informed of the right to select an advisor.&nbsp; At this time PROFITS committee members will receive notice of hearing.</li> 
         <li>If the PROFITS Committee Chair and the investigator determine there is insufficient evidence to bring the case to a hearing, the student in question will be notified by means of direct communication, either in writing or in person, within 2 academic days of the decision that the charge has been dismissed.&nbsp; All documented material related to the investigation will be destroyed and information about the investigation will remain confidential.</li> 
        </ol></li> 
       <li>All cases will be heard by the PROFITS Committee within 15 academic days after the Chairperson and investigator determine there is sufficient evidence to hold a hearing.&nbsp; Cases not heard within this period will be dismissed, unless extraordinary circumstances prevent a hearing within the 15 academic days.</li> 
       <li>Without prior notification to the PROFITS Committee chair, failure to report to the hearing will result in the following action:&nbsp; Failure to appear on the part of the student in question:&nbsp; Decision is made based on that student's testimony given to the PROFITS Committee investigator during the investigation process.&nbsp; The right to further speak to the alleged misconduct or answer additional questions is waived.</li> 
       <li>In instances where the student in question admits that he/ she committed the misconduct, the Committee will be given access to the investigator's report and will meet to recommend sanction(s).</li> 
       <li>The hearing will occur prior to any action being taken by the PROFITS Committee to recommend sanction.&nbsp; If the student in question denies committing the alleged misconduct, a hearing will be held to determine what misconduct, if any occurred and to recommend sanction.</li> 
       <li>Witnesses<br> The student in question, the person who reported the incident and the PROFITS Committee are entitled to call witnesses.
        <ol type="a">

         <li>All witnesses will appear in person to testify before the PROFITS Committee and are subject to cross examination by PROFITS Committee members and the student in question.</li> 
         <li>Facts pertaining to the case will not be shared with the witnesses by the Committee.</li> 
        </ol></li> 
       <li>Hearing Procedures<br> The Hearing Panel will be comprised of the members of the PROFITS Committee excluding the member who served as the investigator for the case in question.
        <ol type="a"> 
         <li>The hearing will at all times be presided over by the PROFITS Committee Chair.&nbsp; The individual presiding over the hearing will decide all questions of procedure, evidence, and conduct of the proceedings.&nbsp; He/she will administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses and members of the Hearing Panel and may recess or adjourn the hearing, upon request of any Hearing Panel member, student, or his/her own motion upon such terms and conditions as he/she deems just.</li> 
         <li>Prior to assuming its duties as a Hearing Panel, each member of the PROFITS Committee will swear or affirm to justly and fairly weigh the evidence and to cast his/ her vote based solely upon the evidence, testimony, and content of the hearing, and to follow the instructions of the individual presiding over the hearing.&nbsp; Extenuating circumstances will not be considered in deciding whether or not the misconduct occurred.</li> 
         <li>The only persons allowed in closed hearings of the PROFITS Committee will be the student in question and his/her PROFITS Advisor, the individual who reported the occurrence and his/her PROFITS Advisor, witnesses while testifying, PROFITS Committee members, the individual presiding over the hearing, and Office of Student Affairs support staff.&nbsp; The student in question and the individual who reported the occurrence each presents his/her testimony.&nbsp; The student in question has the right to query the individual who reported the incident and the person reporting the incident has the right to query the student in question.&nbsp; The name of the individual who reported the occurrence will be known only to the chair of the PROFITS Committee, members of the PROFITS Committee, the student in question, and the PROFITS Advisor.</li> 
         <li>All testimony will be taken under oath or affirmation, administered by the individual presiding over the hearing.&nbsp; There will be a record made of the proceedings by a recorder (human and mechanical) that lends itself to completeness, accuracy and security (e.g., recording, video).&nbsp; Upon written request therefore, any student finally aggrieved by an adverse decision of the Hearing Panel, may request and obtain a transcription of the proceedings, at his/her own expense.</li> 
         <li>No accused student can be compelled to testify at any PROFITS Committee hearing or to answer questions posed by the hearing panel; no inference can be drawn by the Hearing Panel against a student in question due to his/her failure or refusal to testify or respond to questions.</li> 
         <li>After hearing all the evidence, testimony and any argument advanced on behalf of or against a student, the Hearing Panel will receive instructions from the individual presiding over the hearing.&nbsp; The instructions will be on the record and will be read as follows:
          <ol type="i"> 
           <li>The person(s) making any claim(s) or charge(s) against the student which, if true, constitutes misconduct warranting discipline, will carry the Burden of Proof. (Mandatory instruction in all cases)</li> 
           <li>"Burden of Proof," for the purpose of this hearing, will mean that the Hearing Panel must be made to believe by a preponderance of the evidence, that the student in question has committed one or more of the claims or charges offered and that said claim(s) or charge(s) constitute misconduct warranting discipline.&nbsp; (Mandatory instruction in all cases)</li> 
           <li>Therefore, if you believe that (name of student) has engaged in misconduct of the following nature: (list each claim or charge), then you will vote against the student on said claim or charge.&nbsp; If you do not believe misconduct has occurred, your vote will be in favor of the student upon such claim or charge, proceeding in like manner to each claim or charge until all are voted upon.&nbsp; (Mandatory instruction in all cases.</li> 
          </ol></li> 
         <li>After the instructions are given to the Hearing Panel by the individual presiding over the hearing, the Hearing Panel will deliberate in private.&nbsp; After voting and deliberations are complete, the Hearing Panel will adjourn.</li> 
        </ol></li> 
       <li>Determination of whether or not the student committed the alleged misconduct will be made by vote of the committee members.&nbsp; The decision will be based on a simple majority of all present, eligible voting members.&nbsp; Only members of the PROFITS Committee who have heard all testimony concerning the case in question will vote.&nbsp; The chair will not vote except in the event of a tie.&nbsp; When determining the number of votes needed for a simple majority, the base number will be determined by counting the total number of votes cast.&nbsp; Abstentions are not permitted.&nbsp; Voting will occur by secret ballot.</li> 
       <li>If the majority vote rules that academic misconduct occurred then there will be a separate vote by secret ballot on the recommended sanction.&nbsp; The sanction(s) will be determined by a majority vote of those PROFITS Committee members eligible to vote on the case. The chair will vote only in the case of a tie.&nbsp;Sanction options for academic misconduct or abuse of academic resources are defined in Article II, Section 6 of the Rules and Regulations of the University Senate, adapted by the School of Nursing to include abuse of academic resources.
        <ol type="a">

         <li>Warning: An oral or written statement that continuation or repetition, within a stated period, of actions which constitute academic misconduct or abuse of academic resources may be the cause for a more severe disciplinary sanction.</li> 
         <li>Censure: A written reprimand for actions which constitute academic misconduct or abuse of academic resources.&nbsp; Censure may include written warning.</li> 
         <li>Reduction of grade:&nbsp; Treating as unsatisfactory any work which is a product of academic misconduct or which was based upon the abuse of academic resources. Reduction of grade may include the awarding of an F in the course.</li> 
         <li>Disciplinary Probation:&nbsp; Exclusion from participation in a specified privileged or extracurricular activity for a period not exceeding 1 academic year.\Suspension:&nbsp; Exclusion from classes and other specified privileges or activities for a definite period not in excess of 2 academic years.</li> 
         <li>Transcript Citation for Academic Misconduct:&nbsp; The student’s transcript will state that the student has been cited for academic misconduct.&nbsp; This sanction will include a determination of the final grade in the course.&nbsp; This grade may be an “F.”&nbsp; The statement will be permanent unless the student applies to the Kansas University Medical Center Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for removal of the statement and the application is granted.</li> 
         <li>Expulsion:&nbsp; Termination of student status for an indefinite period.&nbsp; The conditions of readmission, if any, will be stated in the order of expulsion.&nbsp; "Extenuating circumstances" may be deemed acceptable grounds for deviation by the PROFITS Committee or the PROFITS Appeals Committee from these sanctions. Students who admit to misconduct may appear before the PROFITS Committee to request a deviation from standard sanctions.</li> 
        </ol></li> 
       <li>Formal written notification of the findings from the hearings will be sent to the accused student by registered mail by the PROFITS Hearing Committee Chairperson within 2 academic days after the recommendation(s) have been formulated.&nbsp; Findings will include the Committee's decision of whether or not academic misconduct was committed.&nbsp; If the committee finds that academic misconduct was committed, they also will recommend one or more sanctions.

    <h2><a id="APPENDIXC" name="APPENDIXC"></a>Appendix C – Non-Academic Misconduct Policy</h2> 
    <p>Students and nursing student organizations are expected to conduct themselves as responsible and professional members of the University community.&nbsp; Non-academic misconduct includes any violation of Board of Regents, University and/or School of Nursing policy as applicable to nursing students.&nbsp; While on University premises or at University sponsored or supervised events, students and organizations are subject to disciplinary action for violations of published policies, rules, and regulations of the Board of Regents, University, and/or School of Nursing, including, but not limited to offenses listed in this policy.</p> 
    <p>The School of Nursing non-academic misconduct process is substantially less formal than a court of law.&nbsp; The majority of cases can, and should be, handled informally.&nbsp; The purpose of the misconduct procedures is to resolve conflict situations that involve violations of Board of Regents, University and/or School of Nursing policies and educate and prepare students for responsible citizenship.</p> 
    <p>Any student or organization conduct that potentially violates the University’s Nondiscrimination or Sexual Harassment Policies or KUMC’s Title IX Policy will be reported to KUMC’s Equal Opportunity Office (EOO) for investigation.&nbsp; A referral to EOO would not prevent the School of Nursing from taking action prior to the conclusion of an EOO investigation if other misconduct is alleged.&nbsp; For information regarding the adjudication of EOO complaints, please see KUMC’s Discrimination Complaint Resolution Process.</p>

    <p>III. Investigation and hearing of suspected non-academic misconduct</p> 
    <p>Any behavior described in section I of this policy constitutes an occurrence of suspected misconduct.&nbsp; Every effort will be taken to process cases as expeditiously as possible by adhering to the time frames established in the following procedure. Occurrences of suspected misconduct will be addressed using the following procedures:</p> 
    <p>Report of Occurrence</p> 
    <p>Any person suspecting misconduct should report the incident in question to a member of the SAP Committee, either orally or in writing within <em>5 academic days</em> from the day of detection.&nbsp; A report may be made by faculty, staff, and students of the School of Nursing or any other person witnessing suspected misconduct.&nbsp; The SAP Committee member receiving the report will inform the individual reporting the suspected misconduct that it will be necessary to disclose his/her name to the Responding Student during the investigation. When a faculty member reports an occurrence, he/she cannot apply sanctions for any suspected occurrence of misconduct prior to exhaustion of these procedures.&nbsp; The SAP Committee chair will exercise discretion as to whether to proceed with an investigation when a report of suspected misconduct is received outside the usual reporting time.</p> 
    <p>SAP Committee members are responsible for reporting suspected occurrences to the SAP Committee Chair within 1 academic dayof receiving a report of an occurrence.&nbsp; The SAP Committee Chair will appoint an investigator from among the faculty members on the Committee and notify the Responding Student within 3 academic days after receiving notice of the report.</p> 
    <p>Investigative Procedures</p> 
    <p>All data gathered by the investigator will be documented in writing.&nbsp; The investigator is charged to speak with the person reporting the occurrence, the Responding Student and other individuals who may be involved directly.&nbsp; If the Responding Student fails to respond to the investigator, the investigation will continue.&nbsp; Confidentiality will be maintained in all cases. In cases where a patient is involved, identification of the Responding Student will be revealed to the University or clinical site strictly on a need-to-know basis.&nbsp; After data is gathered, the investigator will meet with the committee chairperson to determine the need for a hearing.</p> 
    <p>During the time of investigation and pending a hearing, the Responding Student is encouraged to continue attending class.&nbsp; Dropping a course does not halt the investigation of alleged misconduct or imposition of a sanction.</p> 
    <p>The investigator and the SAP Committee Chair will meet as soon as possible, but not later than 20 academic days unless there are extenuating circumstances as determined by the SAP Committee Chair after the appointment of the investigator, to determine whether evidence is sufficient to require a hearing by the SAP Committee or if the alleged occurrence shall be referred to other established procedures within the University related to policies such as: Impaired Student Assistance Program in the School of Nursing, Alcohol and Drug Use Policy, Policy on Nondiscrimination, Policy on Sexual Harassment, and KUMC Title IX Policy.&nbsp; The investigator and the SAP Committee Chair may consult with the Associate Dean - Student Affairs and KUMC Legal Counsel.</p> 
    <p>If it is determined that the information gathered warrants a hearing by the SAP Committee, the Responding Student will be notified of the allegations, told the name of the person who reported the incident, given a copy of the investigator's report, be informed of the hearing procedures, the right to select an Advisor, the right to present his/her version of events in question, and the right not to participate or answer questions in the hearing.&nbsp; The person who reported the incident also will be informed that a hearing will be held, given a copy of the investigator's report, and informed of the right to select an Advisor, the right to present his/her version of events in question, and the right not to participate or answer questions in the hearing.&nbsp; Each party will be notified of the date, time, and place of the hearing no later than <em>5 academic days</em> after the investigator and chair meet.&nbsp; At this time SAP committee members will receive notice of the hearing. If the alleged misconduct is referred to other established procedures of the University, the student will be notified of this no later than 10 academic days after the investigator and chair meet.</p> 
    <p>If the SAP Committee Chair and the investigator determine there is insufficient evidence to bring the case to a hearing, the Claimant and Responding Student will be notified by means of direct communication, either in writing or in person within 5 academic days that the charge has been dismissed.&nbsp; All documented material related to the investigation will be destroyed and information about the investigation will remain confidential.</p> 
    <p>All cases will be heard by the SAP Committee within 20 academic days after the Chairperson and investigator determine there is sufficient evidence to hold a hearing.&nbsp; Cases not heard within this period will be dismissed, unless extenuating circumstances prevent a hearing within the 20 academic days.</p> 
    <p>Without prior notification to the SAP Committee chair, failure to report to the hearing will result in the following action:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Failure to participate on the part of the Responding Student.&nbsp; Decision is made based on information made available to the SAP Committee investigator during the investigation process.&nbsp; The Responding Student’s right to further speak to the alleged misconduct or answer additional questions is waived.</li> 
     <li>Failure to participate on the part of the individual who reported the occurrence.&nbsp; This may lead to dismissal of the charge.&nbsp; However, the SAP Committee will consider the specific circumstances and may, within its discretion, continue the hearing process without the reporting individual.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>The hearing will occur prior to any action being taken by the SAP Committee to recommend sanction. If the Responding Student admits that he/she committed the alleged misconduct, the hearing will be held to determine only the recommended sanctions.&nbsp; The Responding Student will appear before the SAP Committee unless he/she waives this right.&nbsp; In instances where the Responding Student admits that he/she committed the misconduct, the Committee will be given access to the investigator's report.</p> 
    <p>If a hearing is to be held, the Responding Student may, but is neither encouraged nor required to, select an attorney as an additional or sole Advisor.&nbsp; The Responding Student must inform the SAP Committee Chairperson of any attorney/advisor’s name at least 8 academic days prior to the hearing.</p> 
    <p>Either the investigator or the reporting party will present the charge and documents and witnesses supporting the charge of misconduct.</p> 
    <p>The Responding Student and the person presenting the charge are entitled to call witnesses.&nbsp; The Advisor may not serve as a witness on behalf of the Responding Student or question witnesses.&nbsp; Names of witnesses will be presented to the SAP Committee chairperson by the Responding Student and the person presenting the charge following scheduling of a hearing and at least 10 academic days prior to the hearing date.&nbsp; The SAP Committee chairperson will disclose all witnesses to the appropriate persons at least 8 academic days prior to the hearing.&nbsp; All witnesses will appear in person to provide information before the SAP Committee and are subject to cross examination by SAP Committee members, the person presenting the charge, and Responding Student.&nbsp; Other facts pertaining to the case will not be shared with the witnesses by the Committee.</p> 
    <p>Hearing Procedures</p> 
    <p>The Hearing Panel will be comprised of the members (faculty and students) of the SAP Committee excluding the member who served as the investigator for the case in question.</p> 
    <p>If the involved parties or Responding Student perceives that there is a potential conflict of interest with any member of SAP Committee, a specific written declaration of this potential conflict of interest should be presented to the Chair of SAP Committee.&nbsp; If the Chair of SAP Committee agrees that a potential conflict of interest exists, he/she shall appoint a replacement from the appropriate category (student representative or faculty member of the committee).&nbsp; If the involved parties or the Responding Student perceives that there is a potential conflict of interest with the Chair of the SAP Committee, a specific written declaration of this potential conflict of interest should be presented to the Chair of the School of Nursing Faculty Steering Committee.&nbsp; If the Chair of the Faculty Steering Committee agrees that a potential conflict of interest exists, he/she shall appoint a replacement.<br> The hearing is administrative in nature and will not follow a courtroom model or formal rules of evidence.&nbsp; The Chair of the SAP Committee will preside over the hearing and will decide all questions of procedure, and conduct of the proceedings.&nbsp; He/she will administer affirmations to witnesses and members of the Hearing Panel and may recess or adjourn the hearing, upon request of any Hearing Panel member, student, or his/her own motion upon such terms and conditions as he/she deems just. The administration of affirmations will be as follows: “Do you as Hearing Panel members affirm to justly and fairly weigh documentary and witness information and to cast your vote based solely upon the information presented, and to follow the instructions of the Chair?”</p> 
    <p>Prior to assuming its duties as a Hearing Panel, each member of the SAP Committee will affirm to justly and fairly weigh documentary and witness information and to cast his/ her vote based solely upon the information presented, and to follow the instructions of the SAP Chair.</p> 
    <p>The only persons allowed in hearings of the SAP Committee will be the student in question and his/her Advisor (for an organization, the organization may be represented by 2 student members, and these students may be accompanied by an advisor), the individual(s) who reported the occurrence, witnesses while testifying, the investigator, the SAP Chair and Committee members, and Student Affairs assigned staff member.&nbsp; The Responding Student and the individual(s) who reported the occurrence each present his/her testimony.&nbsp; The Responding Student has the right to question the individual(s) who reported the incident.&nbsp; The name of the individual(s) who reported the occurrence will be known only to the chair of the SAP Committee, members of the SAP Committee, the Responding Student, and the Advisor(s).</p> 
    <p>All information shared by witnesses will be provided following an affirmation, administered by the SAP Committee chair.&nbsp; There will be a record made of the proceedings by such other mechanical means as lends itself to completeness, accuracy and security (e.g., audio and/or video recording).&nbsp; Upon written request, any student found to have engaged in misconduct and subject to an adverse decision of the Hearing Panel, may request and obtain a transcription of the proceedings, at his/her own expense.</p>

    <p>After hearing all the information and any argument advanced on behalf of or against a Responding Student, the Hearing Panel will receive instructions from the SAP Committee chair.&nbsp; The instructions will be on the record and will be read as follows:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>The person(s) making any claim(s) or change(s) against the Responding Student which, if true, constitutes misconduct warranting discipline, will not carry the Burden of Proof.&nbsp; (Mandatory instruction in all cases)</li> 
     <li>“Burden of Proof,” for the purpose of this hearing, will mean that the Hearing Panel must be made to believe that it more likely than not that the Responding Student has committed one or more of the claims or changes offered and that said claim(s) or change(s) constitute misconduct warranting discipline.&nbsp; (Mandatory instruction in all cases)</li> 
     <li>Therefore, if you believe that (name of student) has engaged in misconduct of the following nature: (list each claim or charge), then you will vote against the student on said claim or charge.&nbsp; If you do not believe misconduct has occurred, your vote will be in favor of the student upon such claim or charge, proceeding in the manner to each claim or change until all are voted upon.&nbsp; (Mandatory instruction in all cases)</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>After the instructions are given to the Hearing Panel by the SAP Committee chair, the Hearing Panel will deliberate in private.</p> 
    <p>Determination of whether or not the Responding Student committed the alleged misconduct will be made by secret ballot of the committee members.&nbsp; The decision will be based on a simple majority of all present, eligible voting members.&nbsp; Only members of the SAP Committee who have heard all information concerning the case in question will vote.&nbsp; The Chair will not vote except in the event of a tie.&nbsp; When determining the number of votes needed for a simple majority, the base number will be determined by counting the total number of votes cast.</p> 
    <p>There will be a separate vote by secret ballot on the recommended sanction. When appropriate, more than one sanction may be imposed.&nbsp; The sanction will be determined by a majority vote of those SAP Committee members eligible to vote on the case.&nbsp; The Chair will vote only in the case of a tie. Sanction options in order of increasing severity for non-academic misconduct are:</p> 
    <ul type="disc"> 
     <li>Warning:&nbsp; Notice in writing that continuation or repetition of conduct found wrongful, within a period of time stated in the warning, may be the cause for more severe disciplinary action.</li>

    <p>The Dean's decision is binding unless the student files an appeal with the Appeals Committee within 10 academic days from the date of the written notification of the Dean's decision.</p> 
    <p>All appeals will be considered as expeditiously as possible after receiving the written request for an appeal.</p> 
    <p>Appeals must be based on and sustained on the grounds that the decision of the original Hearing Committee was arbitrary and capricious.&nbsp; When filing an appeal, the student will state with specificity why he/she believes the decision was arbitrary and capricious.</p> 
    <p>An Appeals Committee, consisting of the following members, will be established to hear appeals to the outcomes of hearings when brought forward by students.</p> 
    <ul type="disc">

    <p>Flowchart: <a href="documents/son/handbook/Flowchart-policy-Impaired-Student-Assistance.pdf" title="PDF" target="_blank">Model For Policy on Impaired Nursing Student Assistance Program</a></p> 
    <p><strong>PHILOSOPHY: <br> </strong>The faculty, staff and students of the University of Kansas School of Nursing recognize and accept their responsibility to provide an educational atmosphere wherein nursing students may pursue and achieve their academic goals.&nbsp; The faculty also recognize and accept their responsibility to the public, health care institutions/agencies to provide safe patient care.&nbsp; In support of these beliefs, the faculty concur with the University of Kansas policy prohibiting the unlawful possession, use, manufacture, or distribution of alcohol or other drugs by students or employees on its property or as part of any of its activities.&nbsp; We further believe that impaired nursing students may need assistance in order to free themselves of chemical dependency.</p> 
    <p>The University of Kansas School of Nursing fully acknowledges the stressors students encounter in their professional and private roles and recognizes the impaired student as one whose substance abuse and misuse will interfere with their ability to function according to accepted academic, professional, or social standards.&nbsp; In addition, substance abuse and misuse may harm patients, their families, and coworkers and be disruptive in the work environment.&nbsp; We support participation in treatment programs that have goals to provide a lifestyle free of substance abuse as an option prior to dismissal from the program.</p> 
    <p><strong>PURPOSE AND COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM:</strong></p> 
    <ol> 
     <li><strong>Interventions:&nbsp; </strong>The Dean of the School of Nursing has designated a member(s) of the administrative staff, Associate Dean of Student Affairs, to be trained and function as the intervener(s).&nbsp; Responsibilities of this person(s) are to:
      <ol type="a"> 
       <li>assist in the identification and referral to treatment programs, students enrolled in the School of Nursing who are potentially impaired as the result of alcohol or other drug abuse.</li> 
       <li>establish a liaison and referral system to the Kansas Nurses Assistance Program or to a state assistance program where the student is licensed to which all students who are licensed to practice nursing are referred.</li> 
      </ol></li> 
     <li><strong>Student Admission and Progression Committee:&nbsp; </strong>This committee has the responsibility to:
      <ol type="a"> 
       <li>promote and monitor efforts for the KU School of Nursing faculty and students to be sensitized and receive education regarding the impaired student and professional.</li> 
       <li>develop, implement, and monitor the policies and procedures of the KU School of Nursing regarding the impaired student and professional.</li> 
       <li>serve as a model that can be utilized by other professional nursing education programs.</li> 
      </ol></li> 
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>DEFINITIONS:&nbsp; </strong>The following terms are used in this policy:<br> <br> “Student/s” for this policy refers to individuals enrolled in any of the School of Nursing courses either at the Medical Center campus or on-line courses.<br> “Suspected Impaired Nursing Student” may be one whose behavior violates the rules, regulations, and ethics of the University of Kansas and the accepted standards of the nursing profession with respect to alcohol or other drug abuse or a student who voluntarily self-reports but whose behavior does not violate the above.</p> 
    <p>An “Intervention” is carefully planned, and structured.&nbsp; The goal of the intervention is to elicit an agreement that the student will seek professional help for an evaluation of possible chemical dependency (Sullivan et al, 1988).</p> 
    <p>“Evaluation” is determination of whether or not actual alcohol or other drug abuse or dependence is present.&nbsp; If abuse or dependence is found, a determination of appropriate treatment by a professional trained in substance abuse shall be developed and implemented.</p> 
    <p><strong>GUIDELINES FOR A STUDENT ENTERING THE PEER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM:&nbsp; See Flowchart</strong></p> 
    <ol> 
     <li><strong>Self-Referral:&nbsp; </strong>If a student independently identifies and acknowledges a problem with alcohol or other drug abuse to any member of the faculty, staff or student body, the student will be referred to the designated administrative individual for referral to a substance abuse expert for evaluation and treatment (if indicated).&nbsp; The School of Nursing will make every effort to support students’ recovery on reentry by affording them the opportunity to continue their education.&nbsp; Students must obtain written approval from the School of Nursing's designated administrative individual that they have successfully met the criteria of the recovery process prior to reentry.&nbsp; Standards of confidentiality will be maintained during all phases of intervention and assistance and every effort shall be made to reduce the stigma that may be associated with the identified student’s behavior.</li> 
     <li><strong>Non-Self-Referral:</strong>
      <ol type="a"> 
       <li>Identification:&nbsp; It is essential that faculty, staff and the student body recognize their responsibility to act when they suspect a student is abusing alcohol or other drugs.&nbsp; The identifying individuals should document physical evidence and objective behavioral data related to the School of Nursing that support the deviation in student performance.&nbsp; These include specific observable behaviors in class or clinical activities.&nbsp; If they suspect that these performance deviations represent impairment, then they may notify the designated administrative individual.</li> 
       <li>Determination of Probable Alcohol or Drug Abuse/dependence:&nbsp; If the data collected indicate possible alcohol or other drug abuse, the identifying individual will contact the designated administrative individual for a confidential consultation on how to proceed.</li> 
       <li>Intervention:&nbsp; While the optimal solution is for the student to recognize the problem and seek treatment voluntarily, the School of Nursing designated administrative individual may decide to proceed with a planned intervention if behavioral signs indicate a potential problem (see definition under Philosophy). It is important to note that at the time of the intervention, a diagnosis is not being made. An intervention simply indicates a need for evaluation to determine if substance abuse exists.<br> <br> The intervention is conducted without prior notification of the student by the School of Nursing designated administrative individual and may include other appropriate individuals.&nbsp; If the student is receiving mental health care, the student's written consent will be sought to inform the current therapist of the intervention and its outcome at the conclusion of the intervention.<br> <br> In the intervention, each member presents behavioral documentation of the student's actions.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the intervention, the student will be asked to agree to evaluation by a substance abuse treatment center.&nbsp; The treatment center must be mutually agreed upon by the School of Nursing designated administrative individual and the student.&nbsp; When possible, the student will go directly to evaluation from the intervention.&nbsp; The decision to seek evaluation and treatment is the student's.<br> <br> If the student is a current LPN or RN and refuses evaluation, a report will be made to the Kansas State Board of Nursing (KSBN) or to state board of nursing where the student is licensed.&nbsp; For all students who refuse evaluation, other University policies regarding academic/ nonacademic misconduct may be implemented.</li> 
       <li>Evaluation:&nbsp; If the student agrees to an evaluation, it will be conducted as soon as possible, by a trained professional in substance abuse.&nbsp; The student will be responsible for providing the School of Nursing designated administrative individual with a written copy of the evaluation outcome and appropriate follow-up measures.&nbsp; If the student refuses to comply with this provision, dismissal from the School of Nursing may be considered, but strictly for behavioral conduct and/ or performance reasons, which fall within the provisions outlined in the applicable student handbook.</li> 
       <li>Possible Evaluation Outcomes May Include But Are Not Limited To:
        <ol type="i"> 
         <li>If the evaluation indicates that the student is impaired due to alcohol or other drug abuse, the therapist recommends treatment, and the student agrees to treatment, then the student may be placed on approved leave for the duration of the treatment program.</li> 
         <li>If the evaluation indicates that the student is impaired due to alcohol or other drug abuse, the therapist recommends treatment, and the student refuses treatment, dismissal from the school will be considered, but strictly for behavioral conduct and/ or performance reasons, which fall within the provisions outlined in the applicable student handbook.</li> 
         <li>If the evaluation does not indicate that the student is impaired due to alcohol or other drug abuse but includes a recommendation regarding another health problem, the School of Nursing designated administrative individual will determine if further action is necessary.</li> 
         <li>If the evaluation does not indicate that the student is impaired due to alcohol or other drug abuse and the therapist makes no recommendation then no other action will be taken, except in cases where a faculty member has observed the physical evidence or problems.&nbsp; At this point the academic/ non-academic misconduct procedure may be initiated.</li> 
        </ol></li> 
       <li>Reentry to School of Nursing: Upon successful completion of a treatment program, the student submits written documentation of treatment to the School of Nursing designated administrative individual requesting reentry to the nursing program.&nbsp; Based on this information, the School of Nursing designated administrative individual makes a decision regarding reentry and notifies the student. Conditions for reentry will include:
        <ol type="i"> 
         <li>a written certification of successful completion of treatment from the treatment agency/ therapist.</li> 
         <li>documentation of plans for continued involvement in post-treatment support groups.</li> 
         <li>agreement to participate in random drug screens for which the student is required to pay</li> 
         <li>provision for release of information to appropriate faculty.</li> 
         <li>any prescribed long-term monitoring that the treatment team deemed appropriate for the individual student’s case.</li> 
        </ol></li> 
       <li>The School of Nursing designated administrative individual will carry out supervision of the student's adherence to the requirements of the post-treatment follow-up.&nbsp; This includes attendance at appropriate support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and negative drug screens at all times.&nbsp; If any of these conditions are not met, the School of Nursing administrative individual will institute the Non-Academic Misconduct Procedure.&nbsp; Any of the possible sanctions, including dismissal from the program, may be dispensed.</li>

    <h2><a id="APPENDIXE" name="APPENDIXE"></a>Appendix E – Student Grievance Procedure</h2> 
    <p>The following procedure is available to any student(s), graduate or undergraduate, in the School of Nursing, should a Grievance arise between a student(s) and a faculty member or other person(s) (hereinafter called the involved party or parties) pertinent to the student's program of study. This procedure is NOT to be used by a student(s) seeking resolution of conflicts arising because of academic or non-academic misconduct.</p> 
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp; Issues involving grades in a particular class should be resolved between the faculty for the course and the student(s), and will normally not be considered grounds for grievance.&nbsp; Exceptional circumstances must be evident for grade matters to fall within grounds for a grievance.</p> 
    <p>Should a Grievance exist, it is the student's responsibility to follow the proper sequence in the Grievance Procedure.&nbsp; <strong>The student(s) has the right to withdraw the grievance at any point in the process.</strong></p> 
    <p><strong>EXHAUSTION PHASE:</strong></p> 
    <ol type="I"> 
     <li>Preliminary Resolution Efforts:
      <ol type="A"> 
       <li>The student(s) will make a good faith effort to resolve the conflict with each involved party within five (5) academic days of the incident.&nbsp; The student(s) is to meet with or make an appointment with each involved party to discuss the incident in a mutually agreed upon location.&nbsp; The goal of this meeting is to agree upon a resolution to the Grievance.</li> 
       <li>In the event that no resolution is reached, the student(s) should attempt to resolve the conflict with each lead faculty of the course for that semester (if not already accomplished with the first meeting).&nbsp; This meeting should be held within three (3) academic days of the first meeting.</li> 
       <li>In the event that no resolution is reached between the student(s) and each lead faculty, or in the event that the course does not have a lead faculty, or the lead faculty is the object of the Grievance, the student(s) should attempt to resolve the conflict in a meeting that includes all involved parties and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. This meeting should be held within five (5) academic days of the initial meeting between the student(s) and the involved party(ies), or within five (5) academic days of the student(s) -- lead faculty meeting, according to the particular case.</li> 
       <li>If the conflict fails to be resolved after steps A-C, and the student(s) wishes to pursue the Grievance further, the student(s) will have the opportunity for a hearing before the Student Admission and Progression Committee.</li> 
       <li>It is the responsibility of the student(s) and involved parties to keep written documentation of any and all meetings during the Exhaustion Phase.</li> 
       <li>The student(s) has the right to continue class as scheduled.<strong> </strong></li> 
      </ol></li> 
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>GRIEVANCE PHASE:</strong></p> 
    <p>II. Procedure:&nbsp; Throughout the entire Grievance process both involved parties have procedural guarantees as outlined in Article XIV of the University Senate Code.&nbsp; It is required that all steps be carried out within the prescribed time limits.&nbsp; Failure to do so on the part of the student(s) may negate the Grievance.&nbsp; There are four steps:</p> 
    <p><strong>Step I:</strong></p> 
    <p>The student(s) will submit a typed statement of the Grievance to the Dean of the School of Nursing within five (5) academic days of conclusion of the steps in the Exhaustion Phase.&nbsp; Upon receipt of this statement the Dean will:</p> 
    <ol type="A"> 
     <li>Notify the student(s) of the right to select a faculty advisor.&nbsp; In the instance of a Grievance filed by a student group, the student group may be represented at the meeting referenced below by no more than two (2) currently enrolled University of Kansas School of Nursing students from the group initiating the Grievance, and these students may be accompanied by an advisor.&nbsp; These parties will have no vote in the Committee decision.&nbsp; The role of the advisor is to support the student(s) in regards to procedural and/or substantive (relating directly to the allegation) areas.&nbsp; It is the student's responsibility to contact the advisor and obtain his/her consent to serve as an advisor;</li> 
     <li>Forward the Grievance to the Chairperson of the Student Admission and Progression Committee.&nbsp; If the involved party is the Chairperson, the Dean will forward the Grievance to the Chair of the School of Nursing Faculty Steering Committee, who will appoint a replacement chairperson for the hearing;</li> 
     <li>Forward a copy to the involved party(ies).</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p></p> 
    <p><strong>Step II:</strong></p> 
    <p>The Chairperson of the Student Admission and Progression Committee may extend this time period for extenuating circumstances only. The Chairperson will initiate communication with the student(s) and involved party(ies) within five (5) academic days of the time that the Grievance is filed with the Dean to set the hearing date. The Chairperson of the Student Admission and Progression Committee will schedule a meeting of the committee and all involved parties to hear the Grievance. The Student Admission and Progression Committee consists of six (6) faculty members: &nbsp;two (2) of whom are teaching in the undergraduate program; one (1) of whom is teaching in the MS/ DNP programs; one (1) of whom is teaching in the PhD program; and two (2) of whom are at-large faculty members and three (3) student representatives; one (1) each from the Undergraduate, MS/DNP, and PhD Programs. Membership of this Committee may include a representative from another University department if deemed appropriate to the situation. Substitutes for this committee can be appointed by the Chairperson as deemed necessary for reasons of conflicts of schedule or interest.<br> The student(s) has a right to an unbiased tribunal.&nbsp; If the student(s) perceives that there is a potential conflict of interest with any member of the committee, a specific written declaration of this potential conflict of interest should be presented to the Chair of the School of Nursing Faculty Steering Committee.&nbsp; If the Chair of the Faculty Steering Committee agrees about the potential conflict of interest, he/she will appoint a replacement from the appropriate category (student representative or faculty member of the committee).</p> 
    <p>The meeting will be scheduled no later than fifteen (15) academic days following the Student Admission and Progression Committee's receipt of the Grievance.</p> 
    <p>The Chairperson may seek advice on procedural matters about the Grievance from the Associate Dean of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management, the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs and/or university attorney.</p> 
    <p>The process of the hearing will progress as follows:</p> 
    <ol type="a"> 
     <li>Opening Remarks by Chair: a. Purpose of convening to hear Grievance brought by . . .</li> 
     <li>Official record of proceedings will be the digital recording. No other recording will be allowed.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p><strong>Step III:</strong></p> 
    <p>The purpose of the Student Admission and Progression Committee is to gather pertinent information in a fair and impartial manner and to recommend to the Dean of the School of Nursing an appropriate course or courses of action.</p> 
    <p>Within three (3) academic days of receipt of the meeting notification from the Chairperson of the Student Admission and Progression Committee, students, and all involved parties will provide the Student Admission and Progression Committee with:</p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>a copy of any and all documentation regarding the issue that the student(s) identified in the Grievance statement;</li> 
     <li>information regarding a declared documented disability if it is relevant to the issue identified by the student(s) in his/her Grievance statement;</li> 
     <li>the names of witnesses to the conflict.</li> 
    </ol> 
    <p>The student(s) and the involved party(ies) will be responsible for notifying their witnesses of the date, time and place of the meeting in which they are to testify.</p> 
    <p>The student(s) and involved party(ies) will be provided a list of the members on the Grievance Committee, and given the opportunity to review all of documentation and the list of witnesses submitted to the Student Admission and Progression Committee prior to the meeting with the committee.&nbsp; In the event that the documentary evidence or the names of witnesses are not available by the deadline, the student(s) and all involved parties will be given time at the beginning of the proceeding to review the material submitted.</p> 
    <p>All involved parties will be invited to be present during the meeting in which the student’s(s’) Grievance is addressed.&nbsp; Witnesses may be present only during the time that their testimony is required.&nbsp; However, the party(ies) against whom the Grievance is filed, is not required to give testimony or evidence and will be so informed at the beginning of the proceeding.&nbsp; The role of the advisor during the hearing process is to support the student(s).&nbsp; This advisor may not question any witnesses or hearing members.</p>
